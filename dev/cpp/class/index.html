<p align="left">This is a topic that pops up regularly on<br />
<a href="news:&#47;&#47;msnews.microsoft.com">Microsoft's Visual C++</a> newsgroups. In these<br />
days, many people are changing, evolving from procedural designs to more object-oriented<br />
ones. Under Windows, where callbacks are a necessary evil, this causes some trouble.</p>
<p align="left">It's necessary to understand why the trouble arises in the first place.<br />
As many of you know, callbacks are a special kind of function you don't call yourself directly.<br />
Instead, you give a pointer to the function to another function, so that Windows can call<br />
it when it's need it. An example of this are windows procedures, and enumeration functions.</p></p>
<p align="left">To make this process work correctly, strict typedefs are define in the<br />
Windows header files. If you try to use a class member as a callback, the compiler will<br />
give you an error, saying that the member prototype does not match the required typedef.</p></p>
<p align="left">You know you defined the member correctly, yet it doesn't work. So you try using the<br />
address of operator '&', and all you get is a different error from the compiler. What's up?<br />
The answer is simple, yet is not clearly stated anywhere. In C++, class member functions<br />
have a hidden parameter on the stack, which is actually the <font color="#008080">this</font><br />
pointer. That's what allows a member function to access other members in the particular<br />
class instance.</p></p>
<p align="left">There's only one way to get rid of the this pointer: making the member<br />
static. This brings other, more important and hard to solve problems. If you can't access<br />
the class from your callback, then what's the use of putting it in a class? You have to<br />
find a way of getting around this limitation. The most ugly hack is, of course, putting the<br />
instance of the class as a global variable, which the callback can access. While this solves the<br />
problem, it isn't very object oriented, and it leads to code that can be hard to maintain.</p></p>
<p align="left">Windows itself gives you the answer to this problem for many of the<br />
most used callbacks. Many functions that require callbacks allow you to pass an extra, application<br />
defined, parameter to the callback, which you can use to give the callback access to the class instance. An example of<br />
this are the <code>CreateWindow()</code>, <code>EnumChildWindows()</code>, <code>EnumResourceNames()</code><br />
and many others.</p></p>
<p align="left">The above mentioned solutions are the easiest ways to get around this<br />
problem, but are not the only ones. If you're good in assembly (which I'm not, so I'm not even going<br />
to try and explain it), you can write a little stub that allows you to use a non static member function as a callback.<br />
For this you need to write a piece of inline assembly in a static member of the class, and use it<br />
as callback. This stub then handles parameters to the *real* non static member that does the<br />
real work. This is very similar to what Microsoft's own Active Template Library (ATL) does<br />
for it's window procedure implementation.</p></p>
<p align="left">A particular case of this problem is creating window classes.<br />
Well, the easiest way is to use the mechanism provided by the Window creation<br />
routines themselves. What you can do, is have your window class have a static<br />
WndProc method, that you register as the window's window procedure. To give the<br />
this pointer to <code>WndProc</code>, you have to take a two step approach:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p align="left">Pass the <font color="#008080"> this</font> pointer in the <code>LPARAM</code> argument of<br />
    <code>CreateWindow()</code></li></p>
<li>
<p align="left">On <code>WndProc</code>, when you handle <code>WM_CREATE</code>, store the pointer<br />
    received on the window data, using <code>SetWindowLong()</code> with <code>GWL_USERDATA</code><br />
     index.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p align="left">On Subsequent messages, you can then retrieve the instance<br />
pointer through <code>GetWindowLong()</code>, cast it back to your class and call through it.<br />
One note though: If your class is a dialog wrapper, you can't use <code>GWL_USERDATA</code><br />
to store the pointer. Instead, you need to use the <code>DWL_USER</code> index.</p></p>
