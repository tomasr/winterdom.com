<p>If you've ever fooled around with the PSAPI library under<br />
Windows NT to build a list of processes running on the system (using the<br />
EnumProcesses() API), you probably know that you won't get the 16-bit <i>Windows</i> Applications that way. Instead, all you'll<br />
get is the list of NTVDM.EXE instances on the system.<br />
</p></p>
<p>Well, there's a [relatively] simple way to get around that<br />
limitation, but the answer is not some hidden functions on PSAPI or the<br />
Performance Counters in the registry. The answer is to look for the Win16<br />
debugging facilities built onto NT itself. The thing goes like this:</p></p>
<p>The WinNT NTVDM subsystem provides a set of services that allow<br />
a Win32 process to debug 16-bit Windows applications running on the system. For<br />
this, there's a library called VDMDBG.DLL, for which all functions are exported<br />
through the vdmdbg.h and vdmdbg.lib files you'll find in the Platform SDK. Among<br />
those are some calls that allow us to get the list of 16-bit processes running<br />
under a <i>Virtual Machine</i> in the NT subsystem. Most of this function are<br />
documented in VDMDbg.hlp, which comes with the SDK, with one notable exception<br />
noted later.</p></p>
<p>Briefly, What you have to do is call the VDMEnumProcessWOW()<br />
function, which will call a CALLBACK function in your program for every process<br />
on the machine which are Win16 subsystems, which are usually instances of<br />
NTVDM.EXE. On the first version of NT, there could only be one Win16 subsystem<br />
executing on the machine, but on later releases, there can be more than one,<br />
which provides address space separation. For each Win16 Subsystem, you have to<br />
enumerate the 16-bit processes running inside them, which are referred to as <i>Tasks</i>.<br />
For this, we can use the VDMEnumTaskWOW() call. </p></p>
<p>The problem with this function is that in the callback procedure<br />
we only get the Thread ID in the Win16 subsystem under which the task is<br />
running, as well as win16 handles to the process and the task. To be able to get<br />
the filename of the running executable, you would need to call VDMModuleFirst().<br />
The problem is that to be able to call this functions, WOWDEB.EXE needs to be<br />
running <i>inside</i> the win16 subsystem that runs the application. Getting<br />
this to work is a pain the a**, and I really couldn't do it.</p></p>
<p>However, it turned out that there was an even easier way.<br />
There's an undocumented call that appears on vdmdbg.h, called VDMEnumTaskWOWEx()<br />
which works just like the original, with the notable exception that the callback<br />
also receives the module name and the full path of the executable as parameters.</p></p>
<p>To show how this is done, I built a simple, dialog based<br />
application written in plan C. It's small, and doesn't do anything interesting<br />
besides showing the 16-bit processes running on the system, but it does show how<br />
to do it in a clear manner.&nbsp;</p></p>
<p>You can download a zipped file with the project<br />
files (written on VC++ 6.0) from <A href="&#47;files&#47;enum16bit.zip">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></p>
<p> And finally,<br />
here's a snapshot of the sample's screen:</p></p>
