<p>On this article I will briefly discuss how to get the command<br />
line with which a process was started. The technique I'll describe will allow<br />
you to actually find out the command line for <i>any</i> process, not just the<br />
one your code is running in. It's a fairly common question, so here's the<br />
answer:
<p>As it turns out, some process specific data is stored by<br />
NT at address 0x00020498 for any given process. The format of this data goes<br />
something like this:</p>
<p>1. The directory from which the application was loaded.<br><br />
2. The current directory (represented by a single dot ".").<br><br />
3. %SystemRoot%\System32. (usually C:\WinNT\System32")<br><br />
4. %SystemRoot%\System. (usually C:\WinNT\System)<br><br />
5. Just %SystemRoot%. (usually C:\WinNT)<br><br />
6. The contents of the PATH environment variable, with one minor adjustment:<br />
before it goes the startup dir of the parent process, but <i>only</i> when that<br />
directory is not included in the PATH already.</p></p>
<p>Here I have to say that all this was found by experimentation<br />
and fooling around with the debugger. I also thank Slava&nbsp; M. Usov, who was<br />
really the one who figured out that the data format until here was very similar<br />
to what the CreateProcess() documentation state is the directory search<br />
sequence.</p></p>
<p>Just after this goes the command line path, followed by the full<br />
command line, which is the part that actually interests us. Finally, the<br />
executable name appears one more time (<i>might</i>, or <i>might not </i>have<br />
the path included), followed by the Window Station and Desktop the process is<br />
running on. In some cases, the window station and desktop might <i>not</i><br />
appear, if the process is not attached to one.</p></p>
<p>Worth noting: The full data block is in Unicode (which is<br />
logical), so the sample app is written completely in Unicode. Also, the<br />
technique I used works on NT4 and up. To try the sample app, just compile it,<br />
and run it like this: <code>cmdline.exe
<pid> </code>where <b>pid </b>is<br />
the process id of the process you wan to get the command line for.</p></p>
<p>Get the code <a href="&#47;files&#47;cmdline.c">here</a>, and look it over,<br />
there are some important notes along with the code.</p></p>
<p>Finally, some advice: As you've probably noticed, this technique<br />
relies on undocumented layouts of the process environment block, which is<br />
subject to change at any time. If you want a really bullet-proof method (at<br />
least for Win32 processes), you can do the folllowing:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use CreateRemoteThread() to inject some code into the<br />
    process.</li></p>
<li>
<p>Call GetCommandLine() from within the injected code.</li></p>
<li>
<p>IPC the results back to your app.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The obvious problem with this technique is that it seems awfully<br />
complicated just to do such a simple thing. The other reason I don't like it is<br />
that is essentially invasive. Felix Kasza has a sample on doing it this way on<br />
his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mvps.org&#47;win32&#47;processes&#47;remthread.html">website</a>.</p></p>
