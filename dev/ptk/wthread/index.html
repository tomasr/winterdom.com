<p>Threads can be complicated beasts until you get used to them. They are certainly useful, but at the same<br />
time, they can add a lot of complexity. I have seen several<br />
attemps to provide the ultimate thread wrapper class for Win32, including<br />
MFC's CWinThread and several others on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cuj.com">C&#47;C++ Users Journal</a>, to name a<br />
few.</font></p><br />
<P>However, I've never been to keen on any of them. I always thought<br />
there had to be a better way. In December 1999, Allen Broadman and&nbsp;Eric<br />
Shaw published an article on CUJ called&nbsp;"Executing a&nbsp;Class Member in<br />
its own thread" that provided a particular solution to the problem. It was very<br />
elegant in some respects and provided much welcome type safety and a lot of<br />
flexibility: It allowed you to create a thread and call any function on any<br />
object instance you wanted, provided the function had a certain signature.</P><br />
<P>They really had the right idea, but approached it the wrong way.<br />
While it was good and useful, it was unsuitable for any but the most basic use<br />
of threads. The particular problems they had were:</P><br />
<UL><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV>There was no way to keep the thread object around.</DIV><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV>You were left with a raw thread handle, instead of wrapping<br />
  that as well.</DIV></LI></UL><br />
<P>So I took their idea and implemented it in a way that fixed both<br />
of the problems above. It was rather simple: All you had to do was avoid having<br />
the function's signature as a template parameter! This doesn't reduce type<br />
safety at all because even in Broadman's and Shaw's implementation the<br />
function's signature was known, and could simply be deduced from the object's<br />
type. </P><br />
<P>Some time after writing this, I decided to rethink the approach I<br />
had, which encapsulated everything in a single class, and instead try something<br />
similar to what Broadman and Shaw had, which was to have a special stand-alone<br />
thread creation function that provided automatic type discovery. This meant<br />
splitting the Thread implementation in three different parts:</P><br />
<UL><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV>A <code>Thread</code> class, which wraps a thread HANDLE and ID, but does<br />
  not provide means to create that thread. This si the object you get to keep<br />
  when you create the thread, and provides wrappers around several useful apis,<br />
  like <code>ResumeThread()</code>. It also has correctly defined copy constructor and<br />
  assignment operators that use <code>DuplicateHandle()</code> internally.</DIV><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV>A </code>ThreadImpl<></code> template that creates the Thread object<br />
  and has the internally-used ThreadProc. </DIV><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV>A couple of Thread creation functions that provide the<br />
  automatic type discovery.</DIV></LI></UL><br />
<P>Yet another advantage of my implementation is that the class<br />
template allows you to provide a thread creation class, so you can plug in your<br />
custom creation function. I supply two classes:</P><br />
<UL><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV><code>Win32<span lang="en-us">Threader</span></code>, which simply calls the<br />
  <code>CreateThread()</code> Win32 api.</DIV><br />
  <LI><br />
  <DIV><code>Crt<span lang="en-us">Threader</span></code>, which can be used with VC++ C Runtime library,<br />
  which simply calls <code>_beginthread()</code>.</DIV></LI></UL><br />
<P>To run threads, you can use one of the two <code>RunOnThread()</code> functions<br />
provided. The first template argument in each one is the type of the Creator class to use, and has<br />
to be provided explicitly at call time (see example below). </p>
<p>The difference between the two functions is that one is for starting threads on<br />
member functions, while the second overload is able to start threads on global standalone functions, or<br />
static member functions. This is done through the use of an adapter class, called GlobalAdaptor.</p>
<p><P>Using the template is pretty simple, here's an example:</P></p>
