<p align="left">This program is a sample on how to lock removable media, preventing its removal,<br />
by using MS-DOS in21h calls under Win95. Some caveats, however: It will NOT work on NT,<br />
and it won't work on all drives, even if the program says it succeeded in locking. For example,<br />
my own CD-ROM drive, doesn't support locking, so the program will not work with it. Floppy<br />
drives usually don't support locking either.</p></p>
<p align="left">The program can be called : lock <drive letter> [-l | -u |<br />
-s]. -l will lock the drive. -u will unlock it and -s will dislay the lock count<br />
for the drive. The code has complete explanations on the functions, so here it<br />
is: <A href="&#47;files&#47;lock.c">lock.c</a></p></p>
