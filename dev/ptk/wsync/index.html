<p>Using the proper synchronization objects is very<br />
important on multithreaded applications, and the Win32 api offers a plethora of<br />
sync objects you can use. However, using them is not always straightforward, and<br />
there are too many apis to keep track of. To simplify their use in my personal<br />
development, I created a few synchornization classes that wrap the most common<br />
objects: Events, Mutexes, Semaphores and Critical Sections. Also, there's a nice<br />
template that's very useful when you are working with events and critical<br />
sections.</p></p>
