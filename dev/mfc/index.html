<p>Here are some articles and classes I've written for MFC. This was written a long time ago and it's probably out of date by now, but there are still a lot of people around using Visual C++ 6.0, so maybe someone will still find it useful.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="popupedit">An MFC PopupEdit Control</a></dt></p>
<dd>A simple MFC class that behaves like the edit control used for editing items by the ListView Control.</dd></p>
<dt><a href="pretrans">Handling Keystrokes on a MFC Dialog</a></dt></p>
<dd>A simple, but powerful solution to a common problem.</dd></p>
<dt><a href="odbcview">Enumerating ODBC Data Sources and Drivers</a></dt></p>
<dd>
   An MFC app, but uses only ODBC API calls.</dd><br />
</dl></p>
