<p>The ODBC API provides ways to enumerate both DSN (Data Sources)<br />
and ODBC Drivers, and it's actually pretty easy to do once you know where to<br />
look. Here's a sample that shows User and System DSNs installed on the system,<br />
as well as available drivers. It's a full MFC application,but it's pretty<br />
simple, and it's UI is pretty simmilar to the ODBC configuration control panel<br />
applet. The App is written in VC++ 6.0, but should be easy to move to 5.0.</p></p>
<p>As<br />
a plus, the sample shows how to use a CPropertySheet as the app's main window<br />
(instead of a dialog), and how to use parent classes based on MFC to add more<br />
code reusability, while keeping the ability to use ClassWizard to add message<br />
handlers.</p></p>
