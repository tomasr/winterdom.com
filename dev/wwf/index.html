  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt seems you have made some good effort for MSMQ usage with
    WF4.0 \r\nBut getting the source files became tough job by not having simple ZIP
    container of all the related files? Can you please help me to get source code
    for the MSMQActivities solution and test application code either by sending to
    my email ID or publish as ZIP file to download easily? However, thanks for your
    reasonable effort.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nYuvaraj from India"
