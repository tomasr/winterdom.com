<p>My name is Tomas Restrepo, and this is my website. I'm a software developer, located in Colombia, South America. I'm currently working as a Sr. Premier Field Engineer at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Over the past 14&nbsp;years I've developed software using several different languages, tools and platforms, ranging from writing OLEDB providers using C++ to application integration solutions using BizTalk Server and everything in between. My current interests include distributed applications, Unix tools, dynamic programming languages and Windows PowerShell.</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;contact me at tomas@winterdom.com.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, my work has included activities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing BizTalk Solutions</li>
<li>Implementing WCF services, using both SOAP and REST styles</li>
<li>Creating custom WCF transport channels</li>
<li>Developing custom BizTalk adapters and pipeline components</li>
<li>Writing custom PowerShell cmdlets and Hosts</li>
<li>Implementing low-level, standard TCP&#47;IP-based protocols</li>
<li>Writing custom Workflow Foundation activities</li>
<li>Implementing custom JBI binding components in Java</li>
<li>Porting existing C++ Win32 code to Unix&#47;Linux</li><br />
</ul><br />
I&nbsp;was&nbsp;awarded as a Microsoft MVP several times since 1999 in the VC++&#47;.NET&#47;BizTalk categories for my contributions to the Microsoft developer community, usually through the newsgroups as well as through this website and other forums on the internet. I've also been a frequent contributor to Open Source projects and the Public Domain with my own code, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Viasfora" href="http:&#47;&#47;viasfora.com">Viasfora</a>: A productivity extension for Visual Studio 2010 - 2015</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;pipelinetesting">PipelineTesting</a>: My library for automated testing of custom pipelines and pipeline components for BizTalk Server 2006&#47;9.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;qpid.apache.org&#47;">Apache Qpid</a>: I contributed code to the .NET client of the Apache Qpid project (an implementation of the AMQP protocol), and was for a while part of the committer team.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;nant.sourceforge.net&#47;">NAnt </a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;win32.mvps.org&#47;security&#47;fksec.html">FKSec</a>: I contributed the Token class to Felix Kazsa's FKSec, a C++ library wrapping the Windows NT security APIs.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;wsspi&#47;">WSSPI</a>: My own C++ library wrapping the Win32 SSPI API.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I make some of my code and libraries public through my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;">GitHub repository</a>. Please check it out!</p>
<h3>Past Work Experience</h3><br />
In 2006, I co-founded devdeo, a small consulting company focused on .NET and BizTalk development. Before founding devdeo, I worked for 5 years as a senior developer and technical architect at InterGrupo S.A.</p>
<h3>About this website</h3><br />
This site is a recompilation of a little bit of the work I've done over the<br />
last couple of years. It features some articles, some sample code, some<br />
utilities, and even some libraries I've worked on.</p>
<p>The opinions expressed herein are my own personal opinions and do not represent my employer's view in any way.</p>
<p>Most of the code on these pages is released out into the public domain; it's yours to<br />
use and abuse as you please. Keep in mind though, that most of the code here<br />
are samples, not really meant to be used directly in production code, as it<br />
lacks important things like stricter error checking.</p>
<p>There are a few rules, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I make no claims regarding the correctness of the code here. While I try to get<br />
things right, there might be some errors around. Use them at your own risk, and<br />
don't sue me later if things go wrong. Also, if you happen to find a bug or<br />
have any comments, please do write me, and I'll do my best to correct them.</li></p>
<li>I don't ask anything of you in exchange for using this code. However, I would<br />
appreciate it if you didn't take credit for my work. Also, don't blame me for<br />
bugs you introduce yourself :)</li></p>
<li>I'd love to hear if these pages are proving useful in your own work, or if you<br />
are using any of the libraries and how!</li><br />
</ul></p>
