<p><!--start_raw-->I just read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;2002&#47;11&#47;25.html#a37">Clemens'</a> comments on my last entry. I really appreciate it! <code>CoRegisterSurrogateEx()</code> sounds like something I really want to look into. It's a pity we won't have COM+ 1.5 on our hands any time soon (besides RTM being so far away, it will take serious time for the adoption of .NET Server).</p>
<p>I'll definitely look this time into your <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newtelligence.com&#47;esutilities&#47;nwesPublicClasses.zip">ServicedComponentEx</a> stuff, which I missed last time. The Load Balancing stuff sounds interesting, too, although there doesn't seem to be much documentation on it.... I'll see if I can spare some time during the weekend to play with it.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
