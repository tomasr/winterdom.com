<p><!--start_raw-->Here's two features of COM+ 1.5 in XP and Win.NET Server that I think has great potential: Being able to run COM+ server applications as Windows Services. Couple this with the <code><a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;library&#47;en-us&#47;cossdk&#47;htm&#47;iprocessinitializer_0yia.asp?frame=true">IProcessInitializer</a></code> interface, and quite a few new possibilites open up!<br />
