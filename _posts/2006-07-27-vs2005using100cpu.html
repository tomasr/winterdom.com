    I agree with you. In the meantime, you've probably tried this, but have you shut off the "code navigation bar"? http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;rweigelt&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;16&#47;446536.aspx

<p><!--start_raw-->I'm getting this fairly consistently these last few days: After 4 or 5 hours of use, Visual Studio 2005 starts to just use 100% CPU. It doesn't hang (quite), just uses all CPU available even if you minimize it or close all documents. Closing VS and opening it again usually cures it, but it is really annoying. Usually this happens regardless of the kinf of projects I've been working on: I've seen it while doing SSIS work, WinForms or just having a couple of C# and XML files open. <br><br>When, oh when, are we going to get <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;vstudio&#47;support&#47;servicing&#47;sp1_vs05&#47;default.aspx">SP1</a>?<br>
