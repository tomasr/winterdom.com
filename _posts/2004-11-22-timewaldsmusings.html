<p><!--start_raw-->I totally love it that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;">Tim Ewald</a> now has the time to post more to his blog. I enjoy reading what he writes quite a lot. In particular, I love it how he approaches things I've been pondering on for a while and helps me clearly understand that I really don't fully understand it at all ;)</p>
<p>Ohh, and btw, I soo agree with his comment on how toolkits <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;archive&#47;2004&#47;11&#47;22&#47;3628.aspx">could implement</a> stateful services:</p></p>
<p><i><quote>"My concern about using EPRs to reference stateful instances of services actually depends on how toolkits choose to implement it. If a toolkit dispatches a call to an object instance that lives just long enough to process the input message and generate an output message (if any) and leaves it to that object to map additional header info to some sort of state management mechanism, that might be okay. If a toolkit does that mapping for you, i.e., it uses the header info to map to an object that maintains state, that would not be okay. <b>The difference is that in the first case, the developer is forced to be deliberate about how state is managed in their system</b>"</quote></i></p></p>
<p>This is a really good example about how you want a toolkit (or framework, or whatever) to handle the mundane tasks, but <i>leave the important ones to the developer</i>.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
