    I blogged about how I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.georgevreilly.com&#47;blog&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;14&#47;SharingDotfilesBetweenWindowsAndNix.aspx" rel="nofollow">share dotfiles between Windows and *nix</a>.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I have several configuration files I keep on my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;24&#47;ModifyingTheHomeInPowerShell.aspx">home folder</a> for several applications, most of which is what in Unix-speak is usually known as "dotfiles". This includes things like my VIM configuration and runtime files, my Unix and PowerShell profile scripts and so on.</p>
<p>Naturally, I want these to be available on all of my machines, and synchronizing them manually has always been a drag, but so far, I had not really looked too hard at how to avoid it.</p>
<p>The most natural way to do this was, of course, source control, which I wanted to have anyway. It was easy enough to use SVN or GIT for this, but one thing had prevented me from going this way: File name conventions.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2008&#47;02&#47;25&#47;FilenamesStartingWithADot.aspx">ranted</a> about how some cross-platform applications would use a different set of file&#47;folder names when running on windows instead of Unix, and how this was a nasty legacy coming from the old FAT&#47;FAT32 days, but was not so much of a problem with NTFS.</p>
<p>There was a point to that rant, very related to today's post: What prevented me from using simple source control to share my dotfiles between my Windows machines and my Ubuntu machines was exactly this issue with the renamed dotfiles.</p>
<p>In particular, one of the things that constantly nagged me was having to rename my _vimrc and vimfiles&#47; directories from Windows to .vimrc and .vim&#47; when synchronizing them to the Ubuntu machines. It was a royal pain, and one that source control wouldn't solve at all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, turns out there's an easy way to avoid this with GVim on Windows, so that I could use .vimrc and .vim&#47; there as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>It appears that .vimrc is natively supported in modern VIM versions. I don't know when this came to happen, but I just renamed my _vimrc to .vimrc and it just worked. Pure goodness. </li>
<li>Renaming vimfiles&#47; to .vim didn't work right out. But, fortunately, you can change the set of folders that VIM will look into when loading runtime files by modifying the runtimepath option. So I just added this right at the top of my .vimrc file: </li> </ol>
<div class="codebg"><code><span class="Statement">set</span>&nbsp;<span class="PreProc">runtimepath</span>=~&#47;.vim<span class="Statement">,</span>$VIMRUNTIME<span class="Statement">,</span>~&#47;.vim&#47;after </code></div>
<p>Restarted VIM, and it just worked. Fantastic! I'm now simply using git to keep my dotfiles in source control and synchronizing them between machines is simply a matter of doing git pull&#47;push every once in a while. Very nice.</p>
