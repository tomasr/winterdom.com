<p><!--start_raw-->I hadn't looked at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gotdotnet.com&#47;team&#47;fxcop&#47;">FXCop</a> in a while, and decided to check it out again (in part because I'm setting up a new set of build tools for our project including things like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ccnet.sourceforge.net&#47;">CruiseControl.NET</a>). Wow, FXCop has improved a lot since then.</p>
<p>I do have a problem with it, though, that perhaps someone can answer. Is there a way to disable the identifier spelling rules?</p></p>
<p>See, the thing is our code throws hundreds of errors with those rules, mostly because our code is written in spanish (and a mix of english on some parts, don't ask). I did see a way to check the dictionary language in the settings dialogs, but that's not what I want, I just want to ignore the rule altogether. Any clues?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
