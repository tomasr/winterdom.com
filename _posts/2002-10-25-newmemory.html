<p><!--start_raw-->I just unpacked and installed an extra 256MB module on my Notebook (a Compaq Presario 2800), bringing it to 512MB. I got my memory from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.crucial.com&#47;">Crucial</a>, which is a very nice site to buy memory from, as they have good prices and delivered fast!</p>
<p>I would've gone for a full 512MB module, but no way I could afford it. It's feeling much more responsive now, though, and they'll certainly come in handy while playing Dungeon Siege :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
