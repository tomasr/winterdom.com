  content: I was able to use your code base to upload binary data to an Oracle BLOB
    column using a custom .net helper component and calling that component from Orchestration.
    I am happy with the solution even with performance limitation. My usage scenario
    worked well

  content: Your solution works perfectly for me to pass through a zip file. Thanks
    a lot!

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>On a recent project, we had to deal with binary messages in BizTalk Server 2004. Specifically, we needed to run a binary message through an orchestration, both receiving it and sending it through messaging ports, as well as passing it to custom .NET components that knew how to manipulate it.</p>
<p>In our case, this was basically a binary compressed (zipped message), which we decided explicitly not to decompress during a pipeline, and instead always keep it in it's original raw form. Handling it wasn't much of a problem for the most part, since you can apply the same trick the RawString class does, but just keeping the contents as a Byte[] instead of a string (implementing it from scratch left as an exercise for the reader).</p>
<p>The only tricky part was getting BizTalk to receive the raw binary message and fire off&nbsp;our orchestration to process it without&nbsp;jumping through&nbsp;too many hoops. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.traceofthought.net&#47;">Scott Colestock</a> has a great <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.traceofthought.net&#47;PermaLink,guid,c5418f3d-2ea7-4530-ab9c-ae4c49154fcb.aspx">entry</a> on how to receive a RawString on an orchestration, so we obviously turn to that for inspiration. But, even with all the great advice from Scott and both alternatives presented there, it's still quite a bit of work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, working with my friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.devdeo.com&#47;gustavo.echeverry&#47;">Gustavo</a> we found out an easier way that didn't involve multipart message types or custom pipelines. It goes like this:</p>
<p>The BizTalk orchestration is setup to receive a message of type XmlDocument, which ensures that the activation subscription for the orchestration does not contain a MessageType-based predicate. Then, we&nbsp;construct a new&nbsp;message declared using our custom .NET class (let's call it BinaryMessage), and initialize it in a Message Assignment shape by calling the new operator to call a constructor, passing the original XmlDocument message as an argument.</p>
<p>Here's were we differ from the other proposed solutions: Our custom constructor takes an XLANGMessage instance as an argument. We figured it wouldn't work at first because the original message in the orchestration was an XmlDocument and not a regular BizTalk message, but it didn't cause a problem. Anyway, since we have the XLANGMessage instance, we could simply get the body part and call RetrieveAs() to get the contents of the message as a Stream and read that into our internal Byte[] array, like this:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">public</span> BinaryMessage(XLANGMessage doc)<br />
{<br />
Stream stream = (Stream)doc[0].RetrieveAs(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(Stream));<br />
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (stream)<br />
{<br />
MemoryStream tempStream = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MemoryStream();<br />
<span class="kwrd">byte</span>[] buffer = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">byte</span>[64*1024];<br />
<span class="kwrd">int</span> bytesRead = 0;<br />
<span class="kwrd">while</span> ( (bytesRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0 )<br />
tempStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);<br />
Contents = tempStream.ToArray();<br />
}<br />
}<br />
</pre></p>

</style></p>
<p>Granted, the solution isn't terribly efficient (since it does involve doing a message copy), but since we're only going to be processing about a couple messages a day, that wasn't a significant concern.</p></p>
