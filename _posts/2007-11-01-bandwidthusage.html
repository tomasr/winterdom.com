    We both seem to suffer from the fact the more 'trivial' posts about fonts and colours are more popular than the serious ones about coding.
    I think the reason for this is appeal - fonts apply to any programming language and OS, then Visual Studio colour schemes applies to everything from C++ device driver guys to ASP.NET web developers.  The technical posts tend to apply to a single scenario within a specific framework.

    Damien,
    I think you're right about that. It doesn't help that a lot of my more technical posts are on stuff that you could reasonably say very few people care about (like, say, writing custom biztalk adapters). I don't particularly mind it, but it can seem funky at times :)

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>My website usually has fairly low traffic, given that much of it (or this weblog, for that matter) isn't all that well known and I host few big files. Normally, the monthly bandwidth usage for winterdom.com is between 4.5 and 6 GB.</p>
<p>However, bandwidth usage during october jumped to 16.28 GB! That was a surprise, so I started looking at what might have caused it. From my adsense stats and my usage of Google Analytics, I knew that traffic had increased a bit during this last month on the weblog, but not on the rest of the site, which is normal given that I don't update it often and it is mostly used to host the downloads for my samples. </p>
<p>Also, the RSS subscriber base hasn't changed much in the past few months, and is usually pretty stable, right now between 900-980 subscribers.</p>
<p>A few interesting things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="131" alt="Pageviews" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;BandwidthUsage_6E5E&#47;Pageviews_3.png" width="177" align="right" border="0"> The number of people visiting the site certainly increased, a bit more than I had thought, actually. Usually my weblog didn't got more than 500 pageviews a day, but since October 16 I could see that going a bit above 1000 pageviews. </li>
<li>As far as I can see, the increase in the number of visitors has not translated into more RSS subscribers, or at least not to the main RSS feed hosted by feedburner.</li>
<li>The largest usage of bandwidth during october was, apparently PNG image files, accounting for well over 12GB of traffic this month.</li>
<li>A significant amount of traffic driven to my site during october came from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;express&#47;default.aspx">Visual Studio Express</a> site on MSDN; apparently someone over there liked my <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;CategoryView,category,VS%2BColor%2BScheme.aspx">Visual Studio Color Schemes</a> :-).<br>The rest of the traffic sources are pretty much the usual ones, like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wf.netfx3.com&#47;">Windows Workflow Foundation</a> community site, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog">Scott Hanselman's</a> weblog (always a good source of visitors), a few pages scattered around <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;">blogs.msdn.com</a>, and&nbsp; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;damieng.com&#47;">Damien Guard's</a> site.</li></ul>
<p>It's pretty obvious at this point to me, that the most popular entries on this weblog are, by a large margin, my various posts on <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;CategoryView,category,VS%2BColor%2BScheme.aspx">Visual Studio Color Schemes</a> and my old post about <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;11&#47;12&#47;Inconsolata.aspx">Inconsolata</a>. I'm not sure whether that's a good think or simply means that the "serious" posts I write on technical topics aren't nearly as interesting as I thought they could be ;-).</p>
<p>Anyway, looks like I may want to start considering hosting a few of the screenshots I post on my various posts on a separate site (like flickr) or at least stop posting them as large PNG files. Might as well go over Jeff Atwood's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codinghorror.com&#47;blog&#47;archives&#47;000807.html"><em>Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage</em></a> post and see what else might be useful there.</p>
<p>No rush, though, I would still need to serve about 4GB more a month to go over my hosting plan's monthly quota, and I doubt that's going to happen anytime soon! And even so, I suspect the current spike in traffic won't last too long.</p>
