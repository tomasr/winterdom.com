<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>One of my favourite things in the world is reading books, not only technical in nature, btw. So I just wanted to stop my usual technical babble to mention some of the things I've been reading recently. I'm usually a big Sci-Fi and Fantasy junkie, but I also enjoy a lot novels (particularly with a historical background).</p>
<p>I just started reading Edward Burman's "The Image of our Lord", though I'm only in the second chapter so far so it will still be a while before I know if I like it&nbsp; :-).</p>
<p>Just yesterday I finished reading through&nbsp;Arthur C. Clark's &nbsp;2001 Space Oddisey saga (2001: Space Odissey, 2010: Odissey Two, 2061: Oddisey Three&nbsp;and 3001: Final Odissey), and I rather enjoyed them. I loved the 2001 and 2010 films, and so I rather wanted to see how the story unfolded later on (though there are certainly differences between the books and the movies, they are both rather entertaining).</p>
<p>Before that, here are some other books I read recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keniz&eacute; Mourad's Regards from the Dead Princess</li>
<li>Tom Clancy's Executive Orders</li>
<li>Tom Clancy's NetForce: Hidden Agendas</li>
<li>Tom Clancy's The Teeth of the Tiger</li>
<li>Vanessa Collinridge's Captain Cook</li>
<li>Dean Ing's Single Combat</li>
<li>Morgan Llywelyn's Druids</li>
<li>Max Gallo's Napoleon</li>
<li>Jim Hougan's Kingdom Come</li>
<li>Christian Jacq's La Reine soleil (in spanish, of course!)</li></ul>
<p>And possibly a fair share of other books I'm forgetting...</p>
