<p><!--start_raw-->Peter Drayton <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.razorsoft.net&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;04&#47;23.html#a149">asks</a>: <i>"...will hiring managers be looking for MC++ skills to kickstart their new $10M BetterMousetrap project?"</i>. My guess: likely not. What I think will happen is that developers mostly working with other managed languages (C#), or those with large C++ code bases already, will find themselves in a position that <i>forces</i> them to learn MC++ in order to get the work done. As I said once, I don't think the question is <font color="maroon"><i>if it will happen, but when will it happen</i></font>.<!--end_raw--></p>
