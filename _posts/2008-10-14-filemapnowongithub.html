  content: "Hi Tomas,\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether FileMap would help me achieve
    the following: I have 2 apps: App_Collector collects data and writes a 60Kb csv
    file to disk every 3 minutes. The second app, App_Displayer, displays the data
    stored in the files. App_collector  runs all the time, but App_Displayer does
    not, and when App_Displayer starts up it needs to read the 144 most recently stored
    csv files in order to display what it needs to. App_Displayer takes several minutes
    to read and process the 144 files, which is way too long.  If App_Collector stored
    the most recent 144 files in memory, could FileMap be used so that App_Displayer
    could get the data directly from App_Collector, in much less time than reading
    the data from csv files on the disk?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPeter"

  content: You could certainly do that, though you'd need to write some extra control
    information into memory so that the reader could figure out where each one begins
    and ends. However, I'm not sure how "easy" it would be to get working reliably
    given how you'd need to basically allocate a big chunk of shared memory and then
    handle it as some sort of circular buffers (so you'd need to do some serious interprocess
    synchronization to avoid the writer and reader stepping on each others toes).

  content: "Thanks for your reply Tomas.  I will take a look and let you know what
    I come up with.  The easy part is that Collector only writes and Displayer only
    reads. I will use a mutex for IPC synchronization.\r\n\r\nDid you see that .NET
    (Beta 2) has a System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles which seems to contain all the memory
    mapped file io classes&#47;calls one would need, but I cannot wait until 4.0 is
    released, a pity."

  content: "Hello Thomas,\r\n\r\nfirst thanks for the excellent library! \r\nI have
    an issue regarding the license.\r\nBased on the requirements of the project I
    am working in I would have to make minor changes on the implementation itself
    but LGPL would not allw me to do that (or at least to deploy the changed version
    alongside with the other files of my project) if I got that right.\r\nActually
    I think those changes would be commonly usefull, so maybe you just might want
    to accept the changes and change the public version of FileMap.\r\n\r\nThe changes
    are: \r\n1. Introducing SafeHandles instead of IntPtrs to make sure the FileMaps
    are cleaned up in case of an ungracefull shutdown of the application.\r\n2. Making
    The SafeHandle accessible from outside to make own Windows API-Calls to i.e. WriteFile()
    from outside of the FileMap class possible (just like FileStream makes its SafeHandle
    acessible).\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested in changing the public source, would
    you probably just give me your ok to change the sources in my local version of
    the FileMap project, so that I can use it for my project?\r\n\r\nBest regards"

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>After a few years, people still ask about my old <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;dev&#47;dotnet&#47;index.html">FileMap library</a>, a .NET wrapper for the Memory Mapped Files Win32 API, and I get occasional bug reports about it. It&rsquo;s hard to believe I wrote the original code over 5 years ago!</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve now cleaned up the code (alongside some of those fixes), and posted it to a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;filemap&#47;">GitHub repository</a> as well. I&rsquo;ve now updated the code to Visual Studio 2008 and cleaned up the unit tests.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
