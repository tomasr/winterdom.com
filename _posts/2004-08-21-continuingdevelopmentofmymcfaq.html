<p><!--start_raw-->I've been doing some thinking on what to do with my <a href="&#47;mcppfaq">MC++ FAQ</a>, specially given the fact that the language, as it is now, is pretty much dead in favor of the new C++&#47;CLI (not that I complain, the new language is far far better than anything else :)).</p>
<p>So, I'm not sure how it will move forward... should I keep it strictly Managed C++? Should I add a new section for C++&#47;CLI? Should I leave it alone?</p></p>
<p>I'm by no means an expert on C++&#47;CLI, though I've gone through several parts of the spec and tried my share of things, so I'm not sure I'd really have much material now to start on it (or the best person for it, fwiw)...</p></p>
<p>I'd appreciate any comments or ideas :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
