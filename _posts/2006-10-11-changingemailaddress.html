<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've been using my mvps.org address for the past 7 years, but I've been having too much problems with it lately like emails getting lost on the way or getting rejected. So, with much regret, I've decided to migrate a lot of my "regular" email over to a new address on my own domain. </p>
<p>Starting today, you can now reach me at tomas&nbsp;at winterdom.com.&nbsp;I will still be checking my mvps.org address, so assuming it works properly I should still receive anything you send there, and will probably continue posting with it in the newsgroups (for the time being, at least).</p>
