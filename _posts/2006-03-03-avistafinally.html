<p><!--start_raw--><P>I'm happy to report that I finally had luck installing Vista build 5308 on my Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop. Installation was very quick, being done in less than an hour, and was succesful at the first try. This is definitely a big, big improvement over previous builds for me and I'm very glad for it.</P><br />
<P>Aero Glass even works right out of the box because of the X300 drivers included, though I did install the latest ATI drivers I got from their site.</P><br />

<P>Performance is still a little bit on the low side, though it is certainly usable, now :-) That said, I do think that at an almost 8GB for an empty install, it is certainly a bit on the big side...</P><!--end_raw--></p>
