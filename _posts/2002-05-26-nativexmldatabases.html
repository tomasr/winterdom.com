<p><!--start_raw-->As I was reading XML-related things around the web, a question dawned on me: Does anyone know of any Native XML Databases that work well with .NET? (or just plain work at all?) I personally don't need one right now (altough it would certainly be cool), I'd just like to know what's available...</p>
<p>Or has anyone thought of porting to .NET something like <i><a href="http:&#47;&#47;xml.apache.org&#47;xindice&#47;">Xindice</a></i>?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
