    Hi Tomas,
    I have enjoyed your weblog for quite a while. I saw your great posts about creating WCF channel. I also read Nicholas blog, that is great with almost every aspect of WCF. I am here to ask you keep continuing your posts about creating WCF channel. Your posts will not be redundant with Nicholas', rather complementary.
    Glad to see your latest post of channel addressing schema.
    Cheers,
    Kevin

    Kevin: I appreciate the encouragement, thanks for that! My reason for not continuing the series was basically to avoid repeating what Nicholas is probably going to say and felt that posting a blow by blow account of every aspect involved in writing a transport channel was just not going to be as productive.
    That does not mean I won't post on the topic: I simply won't post a regular update on it, but instead will focus on posting occasional thoughts on specific issues I find that would be interesting to talk about (such as the URI addressing issue I posted about today), which hopefully will be more interesting stuff and less likely to duplicate other existing (and better!) resources out there.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Just read that the famous <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;drnick&#47;">Nicholas Allen</a> is going to start yet a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;drnick&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;02&#47;19&#47;channel-development-tour-part-1.aspx">new long series</a> of articles on writing WCF channels, making the stuff I had just begun to write redundant. I'll just stop those since it's very unlikely I'll have anything to say that Nicholas (as a member of the WCF team) won't cover and he's a much more prolific writer than I am.</p>
