    <p>Hello Tomas,</p>
    <p>I actually disagree with you.  The new way (i.e. "febrero") is the correct way to spell the date in Spanish as in: "24 de febrero de 2005".  I think (and I'm sure you already know this) that they had capitalized because that's the English format.  But you might be thinking in other scenarios that I haven't even consider here.</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->It turns out that for .NET 2.0 there were changes in localized names for months and week days in spanish cultures (es-CO, for example). They used to be capitalized ("Febrero") and now they are not ("febrero").</p>
<p>I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lab.msdn.microsoft.com&#47;productfeedback&#47;viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=de265b5a-fdb4-4693-8ed4-3bf105695d24">logged</a> this to see what the answer was, and, it turns out (not unexpectedly) it was by design. I really would like to know just what kind of usage scenarios they had in mind, as I personally feel the change is not very useful, and actually makes some scenarios harder; but I might be convinced otherwise if it makes other scenarios easier!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
