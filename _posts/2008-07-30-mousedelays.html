    Thank you for confirming that I'm not going insane :)
    I've seen the same behaviour with my Dell 2408WFP, so it's obviously an issue with the USB hub inside the monitor

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Yesterday on my post about mice, I mentioned that I was still seeing a <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;30&#47;YetAnotherMouse.aspx">little problem</a> with my new mouse:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>For some strange reason I haven't been able to figure out, however, I'm still seeing moments where the mouse will stop responding (stop moving) for short periods of time.</p> </blockquote>
<p>It now appears that I found the cause of the problem: I had the wireless receiver of the mouse connected to one of the USB ports on my Dell <a href="http:&#47;&#47;accessories.us.dell.com&#47;sna&#47;products&#47;Displays&#47;productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-6107">UltraSharp 2208WFP</a> monitor.</p>
<p>As soon as I plugged the receiver directly into one of the USB on my latop, the problem went away. It's not all that surprising, since I had already noticed problems before when I tried Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 connected to the monitor: keys would randomly repeat in very inconvenient ways!</p>
<p>It would appear then that either the USB ports on my monitor have some issues that cause devices to function incorrectly (possibly a timing problem?), but not sure if it's a general problem with this monitor line or if it's a problem with my unit specifically. </p>
