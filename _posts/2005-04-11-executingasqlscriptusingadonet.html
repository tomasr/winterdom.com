<p><!--start_raw-->Matt Berther posts <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mattberther.com&#47;2005&#47;04&#47;000619.html">here</a> on how to execute SQL Server scripts using ADO.NET, which has its own set of tricks because of the GO-delimiters.</p>
<p>This reminded me that I implemented precisely this feature, though in a different way, for the original SqlTask in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sf.net&#47;projects&#47;nantcontrib">NAntContrib</a> for NAnt. Several people have modified the original code since, but you can probably still see traces of the original code here and there. It was a little bit more general purpose, though, since it allowed configurable statement delimiters, including both regular expression-based ones and a few other thingies.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
