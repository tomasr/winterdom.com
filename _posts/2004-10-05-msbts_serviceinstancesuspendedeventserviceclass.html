<p><!--start_raw-->Looking for ways to deal with suspended messages in BizTalk Server 2004, I turned to the WMI interfaces. One of the ones I'm trying out is MSBTS_ServiceInstanceSuspendedEvent. It certainly works for me, except for one little thing I'm not sure about...</p>
<p>What does it mean when the ServiceClass property has the value 0? The documented values are just 1 (Orchestration), 2 (Tracking), 4 (Messaging), 8 (MSMQT), 16 (Other), Isolated Adapter (32), Routing Failure Report (64); so, what does this 0 mean?</p></p>
<p>Now, I know exactly what's triggering the event (since I'm explicitly creating the condition): A message delivered to a FILE receive location and no matching subscriptions for the message. Any clues?</p></p>
<p>While I'm at it, I might as well ask this: Why doesn't this particular situation also raise a MSBTS_MessageInstanceSuspendedEvent?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
