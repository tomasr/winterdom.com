  content: "Kind of a VIM newb, so pardon if this is a question with an obvious answer,
    but...\r\n\r\nWhen I use your theme in GVIM, it looks exactly as it does in the
    screenshot.  However, when I try to use VIM from the terminal (ie, \"vim example.rb\",
    \":colors molokai\"), the background color doesn't change to that of the theme,
    and the colors are all a little bit different than the ones in the screenshot-
    \ for instance, \"@something\" is kind of aqua instead of orange, etc...  This
    has held true for my tests on OSX, linux, and windows.  Is there a setting I'm
    not aware of?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated!"

  content: "@Alex: Keeping the colors 100% the same on the console is impossible simply
    because the capabilities aren't there. A couple of things that might help:\r\n\r\n-
    Make sure you're using a console terminal capable of 256 colors; not all of them
    do (particularly on mac). You might need to explicitly force Vim to use that by
    doing \"set t_Co=256\" on your .vimrc file.\r\n- The windows console is well...
    totally unsupported, that only does 16 colors so it's a mess"

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've mentioned in the past some of the <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;01&#47;VimScripts.aspx">color</a> <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;07&#47;11&#47;Wombat.aspx">scheme</a> scripts that I've used to make Vim nicer, and there are some really nice ones. However, I was growing tired of them lately. I looked around the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org">Vim</a> site trying to find something better but came up empty handed.</p>
<p>Around that time I ran into <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.hamstu.com&#47;">Hamish Macpherson's blog</a>, and noticed he was using a really nice color scheme on his code screenshots, and then read in one of his comments that it was a slightly modified version of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.monokai.nl&#47;blog&#47;2006&#47;07&#47;15&#47;textmate-color-theme&#47;">monokai theme</a> for TextMate.</p>
<p>I decided to try porting them to Vim, though it's a very loose port. I've been using and tweaking it for a few weeks now, but I'm pretty satisfied with it. I decided to post it here just in case anyone else is interested.</p>
<p>There are two variations to the theme; which one is used can be controlled by setting the <code>g:molokai_original</code> variable in your .vimrc file.</p>
<p>The default option (<code>molokai_original == 0</code>) uses the dark gray background variation similar to Hamish' version, and looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;tomasr&#47;2746280863&#47;"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="359" alt="molokai normal" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;MolokaiforVim_8602&#47;molokai_normal_small_3.png" width="511" border="0" &#47;></a> </p>
<p>With <code>molokai_original == 1</code>, the script will use the original monokai colors, and looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;tomasr&#47;2747115368&#47;"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="360" alt="molokai original" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;MolokaiforVim_8602&#47;molokai_original_small_3.png" width="512" border="0" &#47;></a> </p>
<p>You can get the script from my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;dotfiles&#47;tree&#47;master&#47;.vim&#47;colors&#47;molokai.vim">dotfiles repository</a> on github; where you'll find always the most recent version. Enjoy!</p>
