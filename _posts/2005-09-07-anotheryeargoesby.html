<p><!--start_raw-->Yesterday was my birthday, again; had a lot of fun having dinner with my girlfriend and all my family last night. Our birthday is always a family event, you see, as it so happens that I share my birthday with my mother, and one of our closest cousins' birthday is just the next day (that is, today) :)<!--end_raw--></p>
