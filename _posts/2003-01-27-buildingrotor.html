<p><!--start_raw-->I finally got around installing the final release of the SSCLI source code on my machine and rebuild it. Took much less time to build it than the last time around, when I was still on a PII-400MHz.</p>
<p>I had been meaning to do this for a long time now, but I always kept finding excuses to avoid it... talk about procrastinating! But not more... it's Rotor time!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
