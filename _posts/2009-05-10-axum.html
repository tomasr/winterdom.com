    .NET addition for parallel programming. I am not going to have a look, other things
    to do. If you want to know more, look here. [...]"

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a bit about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;maestroteam&#47;">Axum</a> project from Microsoft, and I&rsquo;m finding it pretty interesting. I&rsquo;m just skimming the surface and to be honest I can&rsquo;t say I understand much yet, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to play with it some more and get a better idea of its capabilities.</p>
<p>I think language&#47;runtimes like this hold great potential for the applications that require a lot of concurrency, which should be more and more common in the future, so very much looking forward to what this develops into.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, right after installing the technology preview, I realized that the current Visual Studio package seems to be basically unusable for those of us liking dark themes, as it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;axum-vs.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="axum_vs" border="0" alt="axum_vs" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;axum-vs-thumb.png" width="640" height="466" &#47;></a> </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see any new options in the Font &amp; Colors settings in Visual Studio that I could tweak to improve this, but I do hope they get added; this is just too painful :).</p></p>
