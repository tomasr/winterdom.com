<p><!--start_raw-->The new BizTalk Server 2004 schema designer (which I still haven't become a fan of) has one thing I really, really dislike: By default, schemas created with it have elementFormDefault="unqualified". Yuck. I always forget to change it the first time, and of course I'm then surprised when BizTalk doesn't catch the values in my XML files in the promoted properties and distinguished fields.<!--end_raw--></p>
