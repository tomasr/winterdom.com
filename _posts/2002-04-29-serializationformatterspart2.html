<p>Serialization Formatters are supposed to be able to serialize a graph of<br />
objects correctly. This implies it has to be able to cope with a graph in which<br />
two different objects A and B reference a third one, C, <i>without</i><br />
writing C twice to the stream. This is very important because when the graph is<br />
deserialized again, you must guarantee the identity of the reinflated C, and<br />
the references to it.</p></p>
<p>This can be fairly easily done via a simple process called <i>scheduling</i>,<br />
which consists of the following elements:</p></p>
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li>
Each object is assigned a unique ID, ensuring that you can spot two references<br />
pointing to the same object, as in the case above.</li></p>
<li>
Objects are scheduled for serialization through a FIFO queue, so instead of<br />
writing an object as soon as you see a reference to ir, you schedule it for<br />
later serialization, but <i>only if you haven't seen the same object before</i>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</div></p>
<p>These two requirements are fairly easy to deal with since the .NET framework<br />
already supports them. Generating object IDs is done with the <code>ObjectIDGenerator</code><br />
class, which takes care of identifying objects for you and keeps track of which<br />
objects you've already dealt with. IDs generated with it are all positive<br />
64-bit integral values. To generate an ID for an object, all you need to do is<br />
call the <code>GetId()</code> method which will give you a new ID if this is<br />
the first time the object has been seen, or the original ID if it isn't, and<br />
tell you so (via de firstTime out argument).<br />
</p></p>
<p>The second requirement, queuing, can be dealt with by using the<br />
<code>System.Collections.Queue</code> class. </p></p>
<p>You can find an example of a simple class that does both of these<br />
things <a href="&#47;dev&#47;dotnet&#47;ObjectScheduler.cs.txt">here</a>. As you will<br />
see, it's extremely easy to do so.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
