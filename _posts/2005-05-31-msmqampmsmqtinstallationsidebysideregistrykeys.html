<p><!--start_raw-->If you want to perform a BizTalk Server 2004 installation that runs MSMQ and MSMQT side by side, there is a well-defined procedure you need to do in order to get everything working right. However, it is sometimes useful to know what that procedure does underneath, and the key here is the registry keys that will be affected by the procedure. So, here are the registry keys that are related to running MSMQ and MSMQT side by side:</p>
<pre><code><br />
MSMQ key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters<br />
BindInterfaceIP(string): IP Address to bind the MSMQ service to.<br />
Notice that it needs to resolve to the machine's computer<br />
name when doing DNS queries.<br />
MSMQT key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\BTSSvc.3.0\MessageQueuing<br />
MsmqtBindingIP(string): IP Address to bind the MSMQT service to.<br />
MsmqtMachineName(string): Name that you registered in DNS<br />
associated to the MSMQT binding IP address. Notice that<br />
it must be different from the machine's actual name.<br />
</code></pre><br />
<!--end_raw--></p>
