    forget to run this through dos2unix before installing under Linux or Mac - vim
    chokes on the dos format for some reason."

  content: Can't believe this was first posted in 207. I thought boo made its first
    appearance in 209. Thanks for the script btw. It's cool to know that there are
    guys interested in Boo.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>While working through the Boo code in&nbsp;JanRain's OpenID library, I got tired of looking at a colorless screen. It's easy to forget how much of a difference syntax highlighting does!</p>
<p>Seeing as how I'm using Vim as my current external editor of choice, I looked around to see if I could find a syntax file for Boo, but didn't find any in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org&#47;search.php">usual</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;">places</a>. So, based on a the info <a href="http:&#47;&#47;boo.codehaus.org&#47;">here</a> and a few sample Boo files, I came up with my own. It's somewhat tricky to get right, but I borrowed heavily from the builtin Python, C# and Ruby scripts to came up with a simple, though usable script. </p>
<p>Here's a screenshot showing the results:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;BooSyntaxforVim_1049B&#47;BooInVim%5B2%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="480" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;BooSyntaxforVim_1049B&#47;BooInVim_thumb.png" width="517" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>Not bad, if I may say so myself, given as how I had not tried this in years :-). I'm sure there are hundreds of problems, but it does the trick for now. I'm still missing a decent indentation script, though... </p>
<p>If anyone wants it, the script can be downloaded from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;misc&#47;vimsyntax&#47;boo.vim">here</a>. Just save it to&nbsp;the syntax directory of your Vim installation and configure your file associations with something like:</p>
<p>:au BufNewFile,BufRead *.boo setf boo </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
