    Hi Tomas,
    Really great testing utility.  I plan to use it extensively.  I did run into a small bug though.  I am trying ot unit test a simple XML disassembler component and am using basically the following code to create my message:
    MessageHelper.CreateFromString("<root><order></order></root>")
    Everything works well except in my disassembler code, I use an XmlTextReader() to do some work on the incoming message.  It fails loading the message as the IBaseMessage Arrives like this:
    < r o o t > < o r d e r > < &#47; o r d e r > < &#47; r o o t >
    This appears to be due to the CreateFromString method using Unicode to get the byte content.  I remedied this by adding an overload that allows for specifying the encoding to use on message creation.
    CreateFromString(string body, Encoding encoding)
    In the integration tests, I can simply add the appropriate decoder component to the pipeline and avoid having to worry about the encoding.
    Again, Thanks for a really useful utility

    Chris,
    First of all, thanks for the kind words; it's great to know of other people using it. If you have other improvement requests do let me know!
    As for your specific issue; yes, it is correct to say that I'm forcing UTF-16 encoding when creating a message from a string; and to be honest, it was intentional. The class does the right thing, actually and also sets the Charset property of the Body Part according to the spec; and that's why it works perfectly with the standard disassemblers.
    If you're writing a custom disassembler, then you should *definitely* be using the Charset property to find out what the encoding of the message is (if it's not present, use a sensible default like UTF-8).

    I spent 45 minutes trying to the out-of-the-box pipeline test components working for and got nowhere.  Downloaded YOUR bits, and accurately tested my pipeline in about 10 minutes.  You my friend, are the hero of the day.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I'm please to announce the release of Version 1.1 of my PipelineTesting library for BizTalk Server 2006. PipelineTesting&nbsp;can be used with your favorite unit testing framework to create automated, repeatable&nbsp;tests for the following BizTalk artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Pipeline Components</li>
<li>Custom Pipelines</li>
<li>XML and Flat File Schemas</li></ul>
<p>Version 1.1 adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved XML documentation (it actually builds the XML documents without warnings!)</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
<li>A new, streamlined and more intuitive API, which also includes wrappers for easy configuration of standard XML and Flat File assembler and disassembler components. The original API is still available, for backwards compatibility.</li></ul>
<p>As usual, the library can be downloaded <a href="&#47;dev&#47;bts&#47;PipelineTesting.zip">here</a>. The package includes all source code for the library itself and its unit tests, and&nbsp;a pre-compiled binary and XML doc comments file. </p>
<p><strong>Using the library</strong></p>
<p>To use the library, you need to reference the following assemblies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winterdom.BizTalk.PipelineTesting.dll</li>
<li>Microsoft.BizTalk.Pipeline.dll</li>
<li>Microsoft.BizTalk.Pipeline.Components.dll</li></ul>
<p>You will need to include the following namespaces:</p></p>
<div class='codebg'><code><br />
<span class="Statement">using</span>&nbsp;Winterdom.BizTalk.PipelineTesting;<br &#47;><br />
<span class="Statement">using</span>&nbsp;Winterdom.BizTalk.PipelineTesting.Simple;<br />
</code></div></p>
<h2>Introduction to the API</strong></h2></p>
<p>I won't cover all the API, however, let me introduce the basic mechanics of how the library can be used.</p></p>
<p>The general way in which the library is used is:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Create a send or receive pipeline. Pipelines are represented in the API as instances of either the ReceivePipelineWrapper or SendPipelineWrapper classes. <br>PipelineTesting provides ways to create an instance of a pre-compiled BizTalk pipeline (including the built-in pipelines in BizTalk), or creating an empty pipeline.</li>
<li>Configure the pipeline, by adding any components you require (if needed) in the proper stages of the pipeline, as well as providing it with any document specifications (schemas) that will be required by assembler or disassembler components in the pipelines. <br>This allows the library to run completely independent of your BizTalk configuration, so you don't even need to deploy your stuff to the server before taking advantage of the library; providing a very quick feedback cycle!</li>
<li>Create input messages to provide to the library. You can create messages with any shape or characteristics that BizTalk allows, such as multi-part messages, adding context properties and so on.</li>
<li>Execute the pipeline: Just pass in the input messages and validate the resulting messages!</li></ol>
<p><strong>Example: A simple XML Send Pipeline</strong></p></p>
<p>The following example shows how to create a standard XMLTransmit pipeline, provide a schema to use and execute the pipeline with an input message:</p></p>
<div class='codebg'><code><br />
<span class="Type">string</span>&nbsp;msgBody = <span class="String">"..."</span>;<br &#47;><br />
SendPipelineWrapper pipeline = Pipelines.Xml.Send()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithSpec<Schema1_NPP>();<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
IBaseMessage output = pipeline.Execute(<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MessageHelper.CreateFromString(msgBody)<br &#47;><br />
);<br />
</code></div></p>
<h2>Example: Batching messages in a Send Pipeline</h2></p>
<p>Here's a more interesting test for a send pipeline. This one will create an empty Send pipeline, add a standard XML Assembler component to it, configured with an Envelope and a Document schema and then feed multiple input messages to be assembled into a single one, encoded with S&#47;MIME:</p></p>
<div class='codebg'><code><br />
XmlAssembler xml = Assembler.Xml()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithDocumentSpec<SimpleBody>()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithEnvelopeSpec<SimpleEnv>();<br &#47;><br />
SendPipelineWrapper pipeline = Pipelines.Send()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithAssembler(xml)<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithEncoder(<span class="Statement">new</span>&nbsp;MIME_SMIME_Encoder());<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<span class="Comment">&#47;&#47; Create the input message to pass through the pipeline</span><br &#47;><br />
<span class="Type">string</span>&nbsp;body = <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="String">"<o:Body xmlns:o='<a href="http:&#47;&#47;SampleSchemas.SimpleBody">http:&#47;&#47;SampleSchemas.SimpleBody</a>'>"</span><br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;+ <span class="String">"this is a body</o:Body>"</span>;<br &#47;><br />
<span class="Comment">&#47;&#47; Execute the pipeline, and check the output</span><br &#47;><br />
<span class="Comment">&#47;&#47; we get a single message batched with all the </span><br &#47;><br />
<span class="Comment">&#47;&#47; messages grouped into the envelope's body</span><br &#47;><br />
IBaseMessage outputMessage = pipeline.Execute(<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MessageHelper.CreateFromString(body),<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MessageHelper.CreateFromString(body),<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MessageHelper.CreateFromString(body)<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; );<br &#47;><br />
Assert.IsNotNull(outputMessage);<br />
</code></div></p>
<p>Notice that, in this example, we didn't explicitly add the schemas to the pipeline itself; that's because when they are configured on the XML assembler, the pipeline picks it up automatically.</p></p>
<h2>Example: Parse a flat file</h2></p>
<p>In this example, I'll create a new receive pipeline and add a Flat File disassembler to it to parse a flat file from a BizTalk schema:</p></p>
<div class='codebg'><code><br />
FFDisassembler ff = Disassembler.FlatFile()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithDocumentSpec<Schema3_FF>();<br &#47;><br />
ReceivePipelineWrapper pipeline = Pipelines.Receive()<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WithDisassembler(ff);<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
IBaseMessage input = MessageHelper.CreateFromStream(<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; DocLoader.LoadStream(<span class="String">"CSV_FF_RecvInput.txt"</span>)<br &#47;><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; );<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
MessageCollection output = pipeline.Execute(input);<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Assert.AreEqual(<span class="Number">1</span>, output.Count);<br />
</code></div></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2></p>
<p>This brief introduction should give you an idea of the capabilities of the PipelineTesting library. As you can see, the new API is&nbsp;fairly&nbsp;intuitive and simple to use and everyone should be able to use it with minimal effort. </p></p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments or run into a bug, do let me know; I'll do my best to answer and fix any issues!</p></p>
