<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Service Pack 1 for Vista is now available for download from MSDN (I guess the Windows Update rollout will still wait to march or something). For some reason, though, it is a 434MB, 5-language pack. </p>
<p>I downloaded it last night and installed it this morning without too much fuss, except for Windows Live Messenger now keeps triggering Windows Installer on startup and failing (but it works after that, funky). </p>
<p>Haven't really noticed many improvements yet, though moving&#47;copying stuff around in explorer seems quite bit faster (that alone might be worth it).</p>
