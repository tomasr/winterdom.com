    <p>All hell seems to have broken loose... Apparently, the hardware must be failing because 5 hours later I still can get XP to install again. From all I can tell, I probably have a damaged memory stick.</p>
    <p>Now I'm gonna have to rummage around and see if I can get my hands on a couple of 100MHz memory sticks (yes, my machine is a crappy 400MHz PII), which is not going to be easy...</p>

<p>I'm <i>so</i> going to enjoy reinstalling eveything from scratch.... ohh, well... At least tomorrow's a holiday here.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
