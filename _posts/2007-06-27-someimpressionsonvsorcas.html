<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Some things I've noticed while using Visual Studio 2008 using the downloadable VSTS VPC image:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IDE, in general, seems a bit snappier than what VS2005 is for me. This is good news, and I do hope it keeps this way.</li>
<li>Contrary to what I expected, the Workflow designer is not snappier. It feels significantly more slow than in VS2005. This is bad news, considering it isn't snappy by any means in 2005 :-)</li>
<li>Can somebody, please, put the stupid Task window out of its misery and stop bugging us with it? It used to pop up at inconvenient times in VS2005, still, but it keeps popping up all the time in Orcas. Extremely annoying.</li></ul>
