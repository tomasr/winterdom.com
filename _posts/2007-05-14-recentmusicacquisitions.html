<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>SAs usual, I'm always looking for good music to have around. Here's a few albums I got my hands on recently:</p>
<p><strong>Leaves' Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Both Lovelorn and Vinland Saga are decent albums, though it strikes me a bit repetitive (i.e. a lot of the songs sound a bit alike). Norwegian Lovesong is a pretty cool song, though, and the reason I started looking for Leaves' Eyes music after hearing it on last.fm.</p>
<p><strong>Battelore - Evernight</strong></p>
<p>Battlelore is a pretty good band, in my book, and this is overall a good album, though not quite great. I think their performance has certainly improved, but I still prefer their Sword's Song album a lot better.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mortenveland.com&#47;sirenia&#47;"><strong>Sirenia</strong></a><strong> - Nine Destinies and a Downfall</strong></p>
<p>This is the most recent Sirenia album, and it's fantastic. Sirenia is one of my favorite bands all around, and both "At Sixes and Sevens" and "An Elixir For Existence" were great albums. This new one features a new lead singer (Monika Pedersen)&nbsp;with a great voice that fits the new style the band has in this new album (even though it still seems like a clear evolution from the past albums). One of my favourite songs is "The Other Side".</p>
<p><strong>Beseech - Sunless Days</strong></p>
<p>Beseech has become a band I like a lot, though I'll admit I wasn't a big fan at first. This new album is great, and imho one of their best so far. I particularly liked "The Outpost" as well as their&nbsp;cover of Danzig's "Devil's Plaything". Highly recommended.</p>
