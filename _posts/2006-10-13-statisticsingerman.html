    Actually, possibly.  If you look at:
    http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog&#47;CachingInASPNETVaryByParamMayNeedVaryByHeader.aspx
    Scott has encountered something similar.  He had a whole page doing it, but I suspect the problem is the same.  It was caching the language version for the first requested language, in this case German.  Hence his VaryByParam solution for the page.  Might want to ping Scott, since he's lead dev, and let me know you've encountered this.

    Humm... that would certainly make sense! Annoying, though!

    You don't need to bother Scott about this one, he is very aware of the problem, the whole development team is aware. And your right it's a caching problem!

However, for some reason, this morning the statistics started appearing in German!</p>
<p>I ended up forcing the dasBlog application to recycle in order to get them back to english. Any idea of what this happened, and how to fix it without restarting the application?</p>
