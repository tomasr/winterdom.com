    <p>The stacking makes sense to me, especially this early in the game.  I think we should let the plug-in thing settle a bit, and understand what the real shortcomings are, before trying to propose new extensions and fragmenting the market.</p>

and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mattberther.com&#47;2003&#47;05&#47;000112.html">proposes</a> a way to<br />
introduce preprocessor support for his MovablePoster plugin.</font><br />
</p></p>
<p><font size="2">While useful, I'm not quite sure if it's actually needed at all.<br />
The reason is that IBlogExtension itself lends very nicely to stacking, so it's fairly<br />
easy to introduce preprocessors by simply stacking them up. Heck, I could easily modify<br />
my own to make it usable with any IBlogExtension by adding a simple extra configuration<br />
dialog. Any thoughts?</font><br />
