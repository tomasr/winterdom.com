<p><!--start_raw-->So <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;">Clemens Vasters</a> is working on a .NET Enterprise Services Book. Cool! That's one book I'd love to read. Unfortunately, it's been quite a while since I've had a chance to practice my German, I probably wouldn't understand most of the book (yes, he's publishing it in German). <!--end_raw--></p>
