<p><!--start_raw--><P><A href="http:&#47;&#47;martinfowler.com&#47;bliki&#47;">Martin Fowler</A> has a couple of good&nbsp;posts on Code Ownership <A href="http:&#47;&#47;martinfowler.com&#47;bliki&#47;CodeOwnership.html">here</A> and <A href="http:&#47;&#47;martinfowler.com&#47;bliki&#47;ShiftingToCodeOwnership.html">here</A>. I prefer the collective code ownership way mostly because I believe it encourages everyone to take responsability for the whole project instead of each one just worrying about his little corner of the code base (which can lead to a "as long as my code is OK, I don't care how everyone else's is" mentality). This is as much for my own benefit as that of others.</P><br />
<P>However, collective code ownership can be hard to grasp sometimes,&nbsp;but I've found out that people sometimes can get used to it far easier when working maintainance&nbsp;on existing code bases. For example, for many people it is hard to grasp collective code ownership when the project is just getting started and just a few lines of code have been written, since the code is barely evolving; but those same people have no problem falling into a collective code ownership pattern when fixing problems and implementing new functionality&#47;forms&#47;features on an existing code base.</P><br />
<P>&nbsp;I've had good success with weak code ownership, as find it a very workable approach as well.</P><!--end_raw--></p>
