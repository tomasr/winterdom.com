<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Last week, I was trying to connect to an SVN repository over SSH, using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tortoisesvn.net&#47;">TortoiseSVN</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.chiark.greenend.org.uk&#47;~sgtatham&#47;putty&#47;">Putty</a>. I found a the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tortoisesvn.net&#47;ssh_howto">faq</a> on how to configure everything and checked it to make sure I was doing everything right.</p>
<p>I tried to connect. TortoiseSVN asked for my certificate password. And then, nothing. I could see that indeed TortoiseSVN was connecting to the SSH server; but just sat there doing nothing. I had to kill it several times to abort the connection. </p>
<p>I had already tried connecting using Putty directly, and that seemed to work, so I kept checking my settings, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out what the deal was.</p>
<p>Eventually, I figured out what the deal was:</p>
<p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="442" alt="puttyssh" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;TortoiseSVNandPutty_7AFC&#47;puttyssh_3.png" width="456" border="0" &#47;> </p>
<p>See that "Don't start a shell or command at all" checkbox? Yep; that should <em>NOT</em> have been checked, as it prevented the server from starting svnserve to handle the SVN connection. Don't know why I had checked it before, but everything worked as soon as I removed it from my Putty profile.</p>
