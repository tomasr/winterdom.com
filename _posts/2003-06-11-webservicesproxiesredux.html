<font size="2">Jorgen Thelin <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thearchitect.co.uk&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;2003&#47;06&#47;000173.html">replied</a> to<br />
my earlier piece on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000305.html">Web<br />
Services Proxies</a> with some interesting thoughts. I'm somewhat ambivalent on this<br />
whole issue. I partly agree with what he says, and I fully agree with his thoughts<br />
that the industry must strive towards giving a clear view of these topics.</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">However, I also partially disagree with him. For example, while he<br />
correctly points out that you can build an RPC-style proxy on top of an asynchronous<br />
request&#47;response interaction, I also believe there are some hidden caveats in that.<br />
One particular that comes to mind is loosing on some of the potential reliability<br />
gains you get from asynchronisity in the first place. Potentially, a system based<br />
on async behavior can more easily deal with long wait times and specially some temporal<br />
failures of some of the systems involved in the interaction with relatively little<br />
development pain (and this is even more true on systems based on things like BPEL).<br />
However, once you lay down sync-behavior it becomes much harder, and the failure semantics<br />
just get more complicated (which might not be a problem for simple transactions, though).<br />
I think this kinds of compromises should be much better explained, too.</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">On a related note (and please pardon my ignorance on this subject)<br />
I also wonder whether the current incarnation of WSDL (even if it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;2003&#47;03&#47;06.html">should<br />
die</a> like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971">Clemens</a> says) is good<br />
enough for describing these kinds of interactions (such as asynchronous request&#47;response),<br />
or whether something like BPEL's roles in partnerLinks are a better (or worse) alternative<br />
to describe them. Any thoughts?</font><br />
