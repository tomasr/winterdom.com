<p><!--start_raw-->While taking some time to peruse issue #8 of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.architecturejournal.net&#47;">Architecture Journal</a> (an excellent resource, by all means), I ran into <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald">Tim Ewald</a>'s and Kim Wolk's article on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.architecturejournal.net&#47;2006&#47;issue8&#47;F2_Flexible&#47;">"A Flexible Model for Data Integration"</a>. Pretty interesting, certainly in line with some of the service versioning stuff Tim has <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;14&#47;21733.aspx">talked about</a>. <br><br>I also found intriguing the concept of tying (connecting is possily a better word) the XML data model with the shared vs. system store model, particularly in the scenario discussed in the article - customer data - because it ties in with the common model in enterprises today of [partially] centralizing customer information in their CRM system, while allowing the recognizing the fact that some business areas (and thus the applications supporting them) will require extra data around it. <br><br>It's a pity this last topic was only briefly mentioned towards the end of the article; I'd certainly would've liked to see it presented in a little more detail (though the basic idea is fairly simple).<br>
