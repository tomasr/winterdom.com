<p><!--start_raw-->This past weekend, I got my old electric guitar back out of it's case, and set to put in all new <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.daddario.com&#47;">D'Addario</a> strings I had lying around, and fiddle with the bridge knobs and screws to get tone right again (I had the bridge settings all messed up... I had forgotten just how <i>hard</i> it is to get them all right!).</p>
<p>Anyway, the guitar sounds again, meaning I can spends some time playing, which should be great.... now I just need to buy a new power strip so that I can connect both my cable modem and the amplifier at the same time :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
