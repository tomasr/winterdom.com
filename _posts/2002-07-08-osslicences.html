    <p>Sorry about misinterpreting your post. I'm curious to know what you have against the GPL, though. I probably have the same distaste for Stallman and the FSF as you but the GPL is just a license (even though I admit to sometimes confusing it with the man who wrote it).</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Regarding my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000117.html">Open Source Musings</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.injektilo.org&#47;archives&#47;2002&#47;07&#47;07.html#open_source">Jason Diamond</a> says: <i>"His conclusion that the ASF == Good and the FSF == Bad is hardly fair or even logical. There's plenty of bad code out there for every type of license"</i>.</p>
<p>Ahh, but I wasn't talking about the licenses when I said that! There was a reason I explictly mentioned the two software foundations (Apache and the FSF): <i>I was referring to the way the foundations themselves work, not the licences under which they publish the code!</i>. Otherwise, I fully agree with Jason in that one should choose the right license for the job (my opinions on the GPL are another different matter).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
