<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>One of my development Virtual Machines has Visual Studio 2008 installed with SP1. For several reasons, I had not done a complete installation originally, but only certain pieces of it, like Visual C# and Visual Web Developer and some of the Team Developer tools.</p>
<p>A couple days ago turned out that it would&rsquo;ve been really nice to also have Visual C++ install as well. I figured I could probably install the missing pieces and then apply SP1 again.</p>
<p>When I tried to do this, however, ran into a snag: I fired up the Visual Studio 2008 setup again, went into Add&#47;Remove components and then, when the setup was initializing, I got an error to the effect that some components could not be loaded, and installation would cancel.</p>
<p>After trying a few times I gave up, started an older copy of the VM I had without SP1 installed and so was able to work around it after all, but still, I&rsquo;m a bit curious. Has anyone else seen this? Is setup just foobar&rsquo;ed after the installation of SP1?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
