<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>On the plane today I was reading the april issue of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.acm.org&#47;pubs&#47;cacm&#47;">Communications of the ACM</a>, and ran<br />
across an article by Rosario Vidal and Elena Mulet entitled <a href="http:&#47;&#47;portal.acm.org&#47;citation.cfm?id=1121955">"Thinking about Computer<br />
Systems to Support Design Synthesis"</a>, which&nbsp;I found quite interesting.<br />
The article is basically about having computers be more useful and less<br />
cumbersome during the initial stages of design (in particular for CAD<br />
applications), but it just seemed to me like the basic premise applied to the<br />
creative aspects of software development, as well (at least for that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lhotka.net&#47;WeBlog&#47;SomeSoftwareReallyIsTooDarnHard.aspx">interesting<br />
2%</a> Rocky talks about, I guess).</p></p>
<p>One&nbsp;small part&nbsp;that caught my interest was: <em>"The first<br />
condition computer software for design must meet is not being an obstacle to<br />
creativity. A good atmosphere for creative processes does not ensure creativity,<br />
but being creative does become far more difficult if the computer tools being<br />
used fail to promote a favorable environment because they are too complex, too<br />
rigid, or too slow"</em>. This seems to apply to development tools in general as<br />
well as CAD systems, don't you think? I'd think this applies to some&nbsp;of the<br />
issues that have being voiced about Visual Studio 2005 lately.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
