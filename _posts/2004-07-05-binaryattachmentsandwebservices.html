<p><!--start_raw-->Someone at work asked me recently if it was possible to carry arbitrary binary attachments alongside XML data in a webservice (in his case, he wanted to pass around some images alongside their metadata). Now, I know it is possible, that's not an issue... the issue is: which way is better?</p>
<p>Now, I know that the "Flavor of the Month" regarding binary attachments in webservice calls is MTOM, but there's no implementation yet (at least not that I know of), and waiting for one would likely not be an option. So, I guess we'd be stuck for now with one of two choices:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Base64-encoding the binary image inside an element in the XML payload, or...</li>
<li>Using DIME, possibly as implemented by WSE</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So.... what would you guys recommend?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
