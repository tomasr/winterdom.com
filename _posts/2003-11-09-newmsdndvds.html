<p><!--start_raw-->As an MSDN Universal Subscriber, I got a complete new sets of DVDs on my October shipment, since they changed the colors and coding of the DVD sets. The new schema is much better, and it makes it easy to organize DVDs and be sure what you need to replace when new DVDs come along. Great work on that front, and much overdue, frankly. The coolest thing is that I can now fit everything that really matters to me from MSDN on 8 DVDs or so, which fit very nicely on the MSDN portable DVD-carrier we get.</p>
<p>On the not-so-good side of things, it seems the new DVDs only contain copies of VS 6.0 and VS.NET 2003, no VS.NET 2002 on sight, which kinda sucks (need to look for the old disk and put that there too in case I need it).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
