<p>After <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.madskristensen.dk&#47;blog&#47;Add+Windows+Live+Alerts+To+Your+Blog.aspx">reading</a><br />
about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;signup.alerts.live.com&#47;brochure&#47;index.jsp">Windows<br />
Live Alerts</a> service over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.madskristensen.dk&#47;blog&#47;">Mads Kristensen</a> site, I thought it<br />
sounded interesting enough to warrant a look and thought about&nbsp;experimenting<br />
with&nbsp;it out on my own weblog. Turns out the signup process isn't quite the<br />
experience I expected:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>The signup page asks a lot of information, much of which seems unwarranted<br />
for this kind of service (why all the need for all the personal<br />
information?)</li>
<li>Even though the page asks a lot of personal information, it isn't a secure<br />
page (i.e. no SSL). Certainly not what I'd expected from the now security-minded<br />
Microsoft.</li>
<li>The page kept insisting that the Contact Phone Number was invalid, but gives<br />
no clue as to what the proper format is supposed to be.</li></ul></p>
<p>Even though I noticed all of this, I still went ahead and submitted the form.<br />
It claimed I'd see an email to complete the subscription process, though I have<br />
yet to see it. It might have been swallowed by the spam filters, though I doubt<br />
it. And why the heck is a windows live services' page a JSP page? :P</p><br />
