Today I pushed to the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
version v3.6 of my [Viasfora](http://viasfora.com/) Visual Studio Extension.

This version includes a few minor bugfixes, and some new features, such as:

* Export/Import settings
* Export/Import [color themes]({% post_url 2017-07-29-viasforathemes %})
* Support for JavaScript template literals

If you run into any issues, or have any feature suggestion, please create
a [new issue](https://github.com/tomasr/viasfora/issues) on GitHub!
