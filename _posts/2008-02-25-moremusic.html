<p>Here's some music I've recently gotten my hands on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dokken: From Conception - Live 1981.</em> Dokken playing live at its best. It's also my second Dokken live album, as I already owned their <em>Live from the Sun</em> album.</li>
<li><em>Edguy: Hellfire Club.</em> Edguy's always a fun band; several good tracks in this one like "We don't need a Hero", "King of fools" and my favorite, "Navigator".</li>
<li><em>Kamelot: Ghost Opera.</em> A solid album, as most of previous Kamelot works.</li>
<li><em>Diabolique: Black Sun Collection.</em> This is a double album combining their <em>Wedding the Grotesque</em> and <em>The Black Flower</em> albums, though the second one is far more polished and a lot better overall (I particularly liked songs like "Dark Rivers of the Heart", "Yesmine" and "Play in the dark". I also own their <em>Butterflies</em> album which is one of my favorites around.</li>
<li><em>Freedom Call: Eternity.</em> It's an ok album, but clearly not their best.</li>
<li><em>Iron Maiden: No Prayer for the Dying.</em> I had a copy of this album many many years ago and lost it, and ran into it a couple of weeks ago at Tower Records and got it. The only reason they're carrying this stuff is because Iron Maiden is giving a concert in Bogota soon, though I won't be attending :-(.</li>
<li><em>Winger: IV.</em> Didn't really expect to get this one, given that I was never really a Winger fan, but it actually has a few really good songs, like "Four Leaf Clover".</li>
<li><em>David Shankle Group: Ashes to Ashes.</em> Interesting album, though somewhat of a mixed bag. So far I'm liking "The Widow's Peak" the best.</li> </ul>
