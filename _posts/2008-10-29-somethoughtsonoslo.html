    I actually did hear in a session that M would be VS integrated eventually.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I&rsquo;ve started playing with the Oslo bits a little, and I thought I&rsquo;d share a couple of thoughts on the platform and its tools:</p><br />
<h2>M &ndash; The Language</h2>
<p>M is an interesting beast, but to me the most interesting part of the platform to start with. In particular, I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing with the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;dd129869.aspx">MGrammar</a> stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thrilled about the close relationship between M (and its tooling) to SQL, though. In particular, I really think that Don Box and friends really need to find a better example to introduce Models and M; it was painfully obvious (at least to me) during the M language talk that many people just weren&rsquo;t getting it.</p><br />
<h2>Intellipad</h2>
<p> IPad is an interesting tool. It has some useful features for developing M models in the M Mode and MGrammar modes; there&rsquo;s some good stuff on this on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;intellipad&#47;">Intellipad Team Blog</a>. Right now, I&rsquo;d expect IPad to continue being an important tool in the M developer&rsquo;s toolkit.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeThoughtsonOslo_E1A3&#47;ipad_2.png"><img title="ipad" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="461" alt="ipad" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeThoughtsonOslo_E1A3&#47;ipad_thumb.png" width="640" border="0"></a></p>
<p>However, what I have not seen really is <em>good</em> justification about why we needed a new text editor. I get the emacs.net analogy, but I have yet to see how creating it was a better option than adding functionality to Visual Studio, where is where most developers would expect to find that functionality (yes, I&rsquo;m very well aware of the irony regarding how bloated VS already is).</p><br />
<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>One thing that really caught my eye was the look and feel of the Oslo&#47;CSD tools: It&rsquo;s very minimalistic, and can be seen in the WF 4.0 Workflow designer, Quadrant and Intellipad. I actually find it rather appealing (though a bit weird at times), but I don&rsquo;t expect this state to last; too clean for MS :-).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
