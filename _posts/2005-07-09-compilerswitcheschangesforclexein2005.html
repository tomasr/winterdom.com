<p><!--start_raw-->For those of you who use VC++, you might have notice that there have been significant changes in the compiler's command line switches that control compilation and compiler behavior. What you may not know is the whole rationale behind this changes, and Brandon Bray does a good job of explaining them on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;branbray&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;07&#47;08&#47;437078.aspx">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm happy with the changes, particularly with the changes to the optimization switches; they were becoming way too complicated and it was not always clear how they interacted and what the best options might be for a particular case.</p></p>
<p>Also, and this might not be obvious, the compiler has a very nice feature now that can allows it to report compiler internal errors (ICEs) to Microsoft. This feature can be controlled, btw, via the &#47;errorReport option.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
