    <p>Been there, done that. In fact, I just resolved a font rendering issue with IE with my new proposed layout (XHTML 1.1 + CSS). You can see the layout here:</p>
    <p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;dotnetguy&#47;other&#47;newbies2.aspx" rel="nofollow">http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;dotnetguy&#47;other&#47;newbies2.aspx</a></p>
    <p>and the stylesheet here:</p>
    <p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;xhtml11.css" rel="nofollow">http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;xhtml11.css</a></p>

    <p>For your information, in IE->Tools->Internet Options , General tab , Accessibility button, you can ignore the hard-coded font size.</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Dave Sieber wrote me today about my <a href="&#47;mcppfaq&#47;">MC++ FAQ</a> saying: <i>"The font sizes are hard-coded on your page, which really bothers me. Kind of defeats the purpose of HTML, which goes to great lengths to provide visual flexibility for the viewer. Try it: in IE, choose View | Text Size | Larger,<br />
and notice that except for the welcome and copyright messages, nothing<br />
changes!"</i></p>
<p>All I can say is: <b>Guilty as charged!</b> This is one issue I'm working on, as well as making both the MC++ FAQ and this weblog pages be XHTML compliant, but it's not as easy as I thought it would be. The fact that dealing with relative font sizes in IE is a pain in the butt doesn't help, specially with Verdana as the font...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
