<p>Last week (and Tuesday this week), my friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.devdeo.com&#47;carlos.medina&#47;">Carlos</a> and I did a small BizTalk Server 2006 Clinic at one of our clients. I think it went pretty well overall. All the people that attended the clinic were very receptive and&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;really excited about the power of BizTalk and its capabilities. </p>
<p>I think one key aspect that helped a lot was that most of them already had experience in EAI projects, Web Services and XML&#47;XSLT, and some of them had experience with their previous integration platform (TIBCO), so it was a lot easier to get things going in the right direction than when starting out with developers just getting into the integration space.</p>
