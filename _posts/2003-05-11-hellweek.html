<p><!--start_raw-->This has been one crappy week<br />
at work. It started off pretty good, and then descended into hell :S. Ohh well,<br />
doesn't look like next one is going to be much better. We'll<br />
see.</p>
<p>At least, I hope I'll be able to be able to manage my time again and spend more time on the <a<br />
href="news:msnews.microsoft.com">newsgroups</a> and<br />
blogs.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
