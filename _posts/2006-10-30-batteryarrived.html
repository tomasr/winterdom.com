<p>A while ago I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;09&#47;28&#47;DellBateries.aspx">commented</a> on the Dell battery replacement program mentioning I had yet to receive my replacement battery. Well, it arrived today via DHL. I checked all the markings on the new battery and it seems to be the same power rating and all (I had ordered the 9-cell battery when I bought my laptop), though it seems to be a bit lighter than the older battery. We'll see how it goes. Funny, they didn't seem to provide for any way to return the old battery for disposal, which I was expecting...</p>
