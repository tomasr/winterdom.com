    Perhaps try this:

    It's still in beta and seems to have less functionality than the IE reader, but at least it's an alternative! :)

    I couldn't agree more. And I even use IE as my default browser. I want a stand-alone version of the reader.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've been trying out the XPS reader in Vista lately to see how much I like&#47;don't like the new document format. The format itself seems to be just fine, I really have no problem with it. But the reader in Vista just sucks; it leaves a lot to be desired. Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>There does not seem to be a standalone reader application; documents always open inside IE, which I rarely use.</li>
<li>Loading the reader takes a lot of time, and it's quite slow after it is running. This is particularly noticeable if you're used to looking at PDFs with the goodness that is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.foxitsoftware.com&#47;pdf&#47;rd_intro.php">FoxIt's PDF Reader</a> (to which all document viewers should compare to, as far as I'm concerned).</li>
<li>Because it's meant to work with IE, the damn thing doesn't work if your default browser is not IE. In my case, I use Firefox 2.0 as my default browser, so when I click on an XPS file in <em>Windows Explorer</em>, the document tries to open in Firefox, which can't display it, and triggers a sequence of uterly useless events. Not pretty.</li></ol>
<p>I'm hoping someone creates a decent XPS document viewer, otherwise, it doesn't really stand much of a chance.</p>
