<p><!--start_raw-->Cool things come from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com">MS Research</a> from time to time. Here's one of them: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;~nick&#47;polyphony&#47;">Polyphonic C#</a>. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Polyphonic C# extends the C# programming language with new asynchronous concurrency abstractions, based on the join calculus. The language presents a simple and powerful model of concurrency which is applicable both to multithreaded applications running on a single machine and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based applications communicating over a wide area network. </blockquote><!--end_raw--></p>
