    <p>Bruce,<br &#47;>
    Thanks, will check.<br &#47;>
    Greg, dunno if that's exactly the same case. I waws hoping to avoid using configuration files, but I have that one as a last resource to try :)</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Has someone else run across this? We've been seeing on some of our developer's machines a case where a COM+ server application running .NET Serviced Components compiled with v1.0 of the framework loads version v1.1 if that's <b>also</b> installed on the machine as well, which is obviously the wrong thing to do, as it can cause a whole lot of trouble with object serialization, for example (most easily seen if you pass DataSets around).</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;328925&amp;Product=complus">KB article</a> discussing this problem with Win2k, which SP4 fixes, but we're seeing this on Windows XP machines, and I can't seem to find a corresponding article discussing XP.... (and yes, the machine seems to be fully patched, according to Windows Update, at least).</p></p>
<p>Unfortunate as it is, just switching to another framework version is not exactly an option here (we're talking 200.000+ lines of code, so switching ain't exactly as easy as just recompiling), and unfortunately, the dev has to work on another app that does require v1.1 :(</p></p>
<p>Any ideas?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
