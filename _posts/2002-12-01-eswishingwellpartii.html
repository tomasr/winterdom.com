<p><!--start_raw-->All this whole recent discussion on Enterprise Services and COM+ has made me think a little bit more on what my own opinions on the whole matter, and I've come to a few conclusions:</p>
<p>My biggest wish for .NET EnterpriseServices is for them to become more <i>transparent</i>. How so? Well, the whole constant COM+ registration&#47;deregistration thingie seriously cramps my development style. I find it very annoying during development, particularly since I've become a unit testing junkie, so usually running the unit tests will mean registering the COM+ applications. Bleagh!.</p></p>
<p>So yes, I'd love to be able to take advantage of those services without needing to registering in COM+. Now, this might seem farfetched at first, but I think it really isn't: As Clemens <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;2002&#47;11&#47;28.html#a42">said</a>, COM+ server applications offer a controlled environment; well, so does every .NET application, and that's the runtime hosting it. So I think it would be perfectly possible to have the runtime provide many of these services to the application. This is obviously an oversimplification, but I think it would be an interesting idea to explore, at least.</p></p>
<p>So, in the end, It's not so much that I think EnterpriseServices is unneeded, but rather, I think there could be a better way to do it in .NET. At least I hope...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
