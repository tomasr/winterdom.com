<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cookcomputing.com&#47;">Charles Cook</a> takes on my comments about <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;default.aspx?2002_05_12_archive.html#76704727">Strong Names and Open Source</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cookcomputing.com&#47;archive&#47;2002_05_01_archive.html#76718799">continues</a> the discussion. He makes some good points, particularly about combining strong names with certificates. Certificates aren't the be-all solution either, as they certainly have been attack in the past (as the attack on the Microsoft certificate, allowed by a fooled employee at verisign, proved).<!--end_raw--></p>
