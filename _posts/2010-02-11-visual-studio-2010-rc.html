  content: "Tomas,\r\n\r\nwill your visual studio themes for 2008 work on 2010 RC?
    I see in your screenshot that they're being used, but did you have to adapt them,
    or do they work just by importing them into vs 2010? hope they do!"

  content: 'Gabriel: They should work, though of course they won''t be perfect. This
    specific screenshot is using a color scheme I''ve created specifically for VS2010,
    though I''m still tweaking it. I''ll probably release it soon.'

<p>Following the release of Visual Studio 2010 Release Candidate, I installed it on one of my laptops. I ran into some minor issues with the Silverlight dev tools SDK, but I hear they&rsquo;ve been <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;DullardDotNet&#47;status&#47;8913471745">resolved for RTM</a>. Other than that, it seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already updated my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;LineAdornments">Current Line Highlighting</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;KeywordClassifier">Keyword Classifier</a> extensions for the RC, so they should be ready to go if you build them from source.</p>
