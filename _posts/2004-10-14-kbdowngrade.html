<p><!--start_raw-->Cool. I love it that with every upgrade of the MS PSS <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;">site</a>, the damn thing just gets worse. Took me a few minutes to actually realize that the home page doesn't even mention the existence of the Knowledge Base (actually, it doesn't seem to be mentioned at all... didn't know they actually wanted to eradicate the term). Yep, you guessed it: the search button is where it's at.</p>
<p>Today's rant was brought to you courtesy of all the internal KB links (like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;kb&#47;282490&#47;EN-US&#47;">this</a>) that don't work.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
