<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;">Tim</a> has an interesting <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;05&#47;22963.aspx">post<br />
here</a> about dealing with semantic changes in existing interfaces on Web<br />
Services (continuing from his posts <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;14&#47;21733.aspx">here</a>,<br />

and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;tewald&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;24&#47;22570.aspx">here</a>).<br />
I found this particularly interesting because we followed a very similar<br />
approach on our last project.</p></p>
<p>In our case, we had a set of existing operations on a service with an<br />
existing client using it, and needed to extend it with new operations. That was<br />
no problem. However, during development we noticed that due to changes in a<br />
backend LOB application our services connected with a new field was needed some<br />
of the original operations. In particular, we needed the client to let us know<br />
on what TimeZone (or rather what the time shift from UTC) to use when<br />
registering the time some operations occurred. However, we required the original<br />
client didn't change.</p></p>
<p>What we ended up doing was basically making the new TimeZone field optional,<br />
and then introducing logic on the operations that checked if it was missing. If<br />
it was, instead of simply assuming a global default value, we actually queried<br />
our security configuration and extracted a default value for this field that was<br />
specific to the client making the call. This was possible because&nbsp;the<br />
services were using WS-Security for authenticating the caller. This way, we<br />
could actually set especific default values for other clients if needed. It<br />
worked very nicely overall and was remarkably easy to put in place.</p></p>
<p>Some of you might be wondering how we dealt with DST: We didn't. A explicit<br />
decision from the business side was made not to support it because of some<br />
complexity in the business side of things, and particularly because it would've<br />
required clients in <em>other countries</em> to make changes to existing<br />
infrastructure and the benefits just were not worth it. One thing we did learn<br />
from that experience was that handling date and time fields in webservices where<br />
consumers and service-providers are on different countries and time zones can be<br />
easily get quite tricky, and that the way .NET <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;mattavis&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;10&#47;11&#47;479782.aspx">handles</a><br />

on WebServices does not make things any easier.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
