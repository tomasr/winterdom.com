<p><a href="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;Foobar2000_A9C7&#47;Foobar200016.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="182" alt="Foobar2000 Screenshot" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;Foobar2000_A9C7&#47;Foobar2000_thumb14.jpg" width="300" align="right" border="0"></a>One of the tools I've been a very happy user of for the past couple of years is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.foobar2000.org&#47;">Foobar2000</a>, a nifty, simple and lightweight Win32 music player.&nbsp;Plenty of reasons I like&nbsp;it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a great plug-in models, with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.foobar2000.org&#47;components&#47;index.html">several plugins</a> available for almost anything you want.</li>
<li>It has a dead-simple UI, though you can get <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hydrogenaudio.org&#47;forums&#47;index.php?showtopic=43077">pretty fancy</a> with it if that's what you like.</li>
<li>Extremely flexible; pretty much every part of it can be configured or manipulated one way or another.</li>
<li>Very light weight. I use it when I just want to listen to some music and I already know what I want, and it beats the crap out of having to open iTunes for that.</li>
<li>Plays pretty much any format out there (with the right plugin). Granted, doesn't care much (that I know of) for heavily-DRM ladden formats, but I don't use those, so that's not a problem (my entire music collection went to DRM-free MP3 a long time ago)</li>
<li>Has a&nbsp;very flexible&nbsp;masstagger and file renaming feature.</li>
<li>I also use it to rip my cds into MP3 with the help of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lame.sourceforge.net&#47;">LAME</a>.</li></ul>
<p>All in all, a pretty sweet and small package to keep around.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
