<p><!--start_raw-->I've always liked searching around for nice monotype fonts to use with code editors and such, but they are pretty hard to come by... To this date, I still rely almost exclusively on good ol' Lucida Console, or, ocassionally, on Lucida Sans Typewriter.</p>
<p>Looking around this morning, I found one that seem like the type I might get used to, although I'll have to experiment with it a little at first. The font is Anonymous, avaliable <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ms-studio.com&#47;FontSales&#47;anonymous.html">here</a> (this one is a truetype font, which is nice).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
