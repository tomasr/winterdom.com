<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.morty.info&#47;blog&#47;current.aspx">Morten</a> wonders about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;morty.info&#47;blog&#47;2003&#47;2.aspx#section-77856c10-15be-47f1-b5fa-2552341c338c">Enterprise Services and Exceptions</a>. This is a topic that interests me greatly, and one I've had mixed success with.</p>
<p>For all I can see, having an <code>object</code> somewhere on your method signature (either as an argument or return type) ensures the custom exception is marshaled back to the client. It seems this needs to be of type <code>object</code>, too, because replacing it by some other reference type (like <code>string</code>), doesn't work, and you get back <code>ApplicationException</code> again.</p></p>
<p>But, alas, I'm not sure if this is just a side-effect, or this is indeed the real reason, which I highly doubt. Same appears to happen with the .NET framework v1.1, btw, at least insofar as I can see. Clues, anyone?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
