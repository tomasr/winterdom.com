    <p>hi there</p>
    <p>i see you're a 'shark' in these matters, and i'd be thrilled if u could give me some advise.</p>
    <p>i'm having some trouble with a server sending a large amount of data in response to a client call.<br &#47;>
    i'm trying to solve this via custom sinks.<br &#47;>
    i've already written the IRemotingFormatter (a cute code - using zlib's stream compression component over the result of BinaryFormatter).<br &#47;>
    i'm having a little trouble writing the sink, though: <br &#47;>
    - i see under the  tag i need to use a sinkprovider class (?? why did they call it 'formatter' then?) what is it supposed to do? only create my custom sink and call it?<br &#47;>
    - what kind of sinks do i need to create? from what should they inherit or implement?</p>
    <p>thanks<br &#47;>
    </p>

<p><font color="#669933">Formatters and Remoting</font></p></p>
<p>It's pretty obvious that Serialization Formatters are not only meant to aid in<br />
object persistence, but also play a very important role in the marshaling of<br />
objects across remoting boundaries.</p></p>
<p>Overall, when I look at the extensibility of the Remoting framework in .NET,<br />
I'm throughly impressed. The MS people who worked on it did a very fine job in<br />
making the framework as extensible as possible. However, there are some raw<br />
spots, and how Serialization Formatters hook into the remoting infrastructure<br />
is, imho, one of them.</p></p>
<p>The extensibility model of remoting is, at its very core, based on channels and<br />
channel sink chains, developed on top of a set of interfaces like<br />
IClientChannelSink and IServerChannelSink, and chains of sink providers that<br />
act as class factories for the sinks themselves (based on <code>IClientChannelSinkProvider</code><br />
and <code>IServerChannelSinkProvider</code>).<br />
</p></p>
<p>On the other hand, Serialization formatters are based on the implementation of<br />
the <code>IFormatter</code> interface; however, there's also the<br />
not-so-well-known <code>IRemotingFormatter</code> interface. The definition of<br />
the two are very much alike, except <code>IRemotingFormatter's</code> method<br />
take an extra <code>Header[]</code> argument. Both SoapFormatter and<br />
BinaryFormatter implement the <code>IRemotingFormatter</code> interface.<br />
</p></p>
<p>What's not so apparent is just how formatters plug into the remoting process.<br />
If you look at the framework docs, you'll see that this is done a set of<br />
classes implementing the <code>IClientFormatterSink</code> interface (on the<br />
client side), and the <code>IChannelSinkBase&#47;IServerChannelSink</code> interfaces<br />
on the server side. <code>IClientFormatterSink</code> is just an interface<br />
combining the <code>IChannelSinkBase</code>, <code>IClientChannelSink</code> and<br />
<code>IMessageSink</code> interfaces.<br />
</p></p>
<p>As you can see, this just means that, in essence you have to implement two<br />
channel sinks of your own to plug your custom formatter into the remoting<br />
infrastructure, not to mention two extra sink provider classes! Where does that<br />
leave the <code>IFormatter</code> and <code>IRemotingFormatter</code> interfaces?<br />
Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.</p></p>
<p>So here's where my rant is aimed: <i>Why take the trouble to define the interfaces<br />
if you're not going to use them anyway?</i> Makes no sense to me. It just<br />
seems like too much trouble writing full-fledged channel sinks just to do what<br />
should be a much simpler task.</p></p>
<p>But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that formatter sinks are not <i>really</i><br />
full-fledged channel sinks. In reality, there are only two things in the <code>IClientChannelSink</code><br />
implementation of a formatter sink that are actually called by the runtime:<br />
NextChannelSink, and AsyncProcessResponse(). The others, you can leave<br />
unimplemented. Now, to me, somehow, this doesn't seem quite right. Thanks to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dotnetremoting.cc&#47;DotNetCentric&#47;"><br />
Ingo</a>, I know understand why it was done this way. I was talking to him<br />
earlier to day and I'm going to quote him on this, since he puts it much better<br />
than I ever could:</p><br />
<quote><br />
<i><font size="-1"></p>
<p>
If you question this design, you'd have to question the complete separation in<br />
IMessageSink, IClientChannelSink, IServerChannelSink and maybe even<br />
IDynamicSink - I tended to do this [question it] in the past as well but I<br />
somehow changed my attitude towards it ;-)</p></p>
<p>
I now agree with MS' designers that it's a Good Thing to have two interfaces,<br />
whereas one works on messages and the other works on stream&#47;headers. So ...<br />
when having two interface, you necessarily have one class which provides for<br />
the transition between those two. Well, that's the IFormatterSink ;-).</p></p>
<p>
In front of the formatter, you've got IMessageSinks and after it you work with<br />
IClientChannelSinks. However, to keep this consistent, the reply simply _has_<br />
to be handled by IClientChannelSink for a formatter. Remember:<br />
IClientChannelSink means dealing with stream&#47;header wheras IMessageSink means<br />
dealing with Messages ;-)</p><br />
</font></i><br />
</quote></p>
<p>He's obviously got a point here. I can't, however, keep away the feeling that<br />
something's smells fishy here... I still believe it could have been done<br />
differently.</p></p>
<p>Ingo did point out to me something extremely important:<br />
<quote><br />
<i><font size="-1">However, there should be an IMessageSinkProvider interface ...<br />
this really bugs me. You have to create an IMessageSink via an<br />
IClientChannelSinkProvider, thereby leading to a must-have implementation of<br />
IClientChannelSink as well. This interface's implementation will quite likely<br />
only throw exception on each method because it's programmed to deal with<br />
messages instead of streams and thereby has to be placed in front of the<br />
formatter. </font></i><br />
</quote></p></p>
<p>
I totally agree with this.</p></p>
<p>If you're still wondering why write channel sinks in the first place: Well, if<br />
you look at the formatter sinks for the two default formatters in the framework<br />
you'll quickly realize why: <i>They need to manipulate transport headers!</i>.<br />
This, quite honestly, could have been achieved without the need for full<br />
channel sink implementations. Instead, MS could have just added generic<br />
formatter sinks that could be instructed to use a given IFormatter or<br />
IRemotingFormatter implementation, and added a new interface to allow them to<br />
manipulate the transport headers, <i>if needed</i><br />
. This would have taken a lot of trouble of writing remoting formatters away.</p></p>
<p>And no, <code>IRemotingFormatter</code> is <i>not</i> the interface to use<br />
here, for several reasons. For starters, IRemotingFormatter implementations<br />
cannot change the headers passed in to them (well, at least they can't add new<br />
ones). There's also a slight impedance mismatch between the <code>Header[]</code><br />
argument pass in to <code>IRemotingFormatter</code> and the <code>ITransportHeaders</code><br />
interface used in channel sinks to deal with headers. So, what purpose does <code>IRemotingFormatter</code><br />
server in real life? As far as I can see, none at all. At least I couldn't spot<br />
any place where its methods are actually called... Perhaps I missed something,<br />
and if I did, I'd love to <a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">hear</a> about it!<br />
</p></p>
<p>One of the downsides of all this is that it leads to a tight coupling between a<br />
given formatter and the channel underneath, via the formatter sink. This can be<br />
easily witnessed on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;sample.asp?url=&#47;MSDN-FILES&#47;027&#47;001&#47;901&#47;msdncompositedoc.xml&amp;frame=true"><br />
Rotor</a> sources where the default formatter sinks actually <i>check what<br />
channel</i> they are working on top of, and adjust their behavior based on<br />
it [1]. Or even worse, does things that should've been left to one of the<br />
transport sinks underneath, like <code>headers["__RequestVerb"] =<br />
"POST";</code></p></p>
<p>[1] This is required, in part, by some of the protocols, like SOAP, which<br />
require the transport headers manipulated. For example, the HTTP result code<br />
might need to be changed if the server's sending a fault or an actual<br />
respose...</p><br />
