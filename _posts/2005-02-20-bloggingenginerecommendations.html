<p><!--start_raw-->I've been lately considering changing blogging engines (for some things, Movable Type is a little bit too inflexible for my taste, although it has worked very nicely for the past two years). Can anyone recommend a choice? The one thing that has been holding me back on doing this is, of course, breaking the URLs and links accumulated to my entries over all this time...</p>
<p>I've been considering either DasBlog or .Text. What do you guys prefer? Any tips on migrating my existing content over to the new engine? Also, how hard is it to create new templates for either one (as I'd like to put something that resembles my existing templates in place). Any feedback is welcome :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
