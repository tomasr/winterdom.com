    Do you have any add-ins installed?  These are most often the cause of instability in Outlook.  You can take a look by opening the Trust Center (Tools -> Trust Center), and then clicking on the add-ins tab.  Try disabling any 3rd party add-ins you have installed and see if that makes it work better.

    Ryan: Thanks for the comment. I haven't installed any third party addins, and the only enabled addins seem to be:
    - Microsoft Outlook Mobile Service
    - Microsoft VBA for Outlook Addin
    - OneNote Notes about Outlook Items
    - Windows Search Email Indexer.
    Any of those ring a bell?

    Disabling third party programs is not the issue here - Outlook 2007 is the most unstable application Microsoft has ever created and no one wants to own up to this. If you reinstall Office 2003, all these hiccups will disappear...what about that!!!

    Uninstall Adobe Acrobat Reader x.x then install Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.x.
    Outlook 2007 works fine in Vista, no problems. Just check all add&#47;plug ons&#47;ins etc.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I like Office 2007, and even though the early betas were very shaky, it is now fairly reliable. The one exception was Outlook 2007, which I used all throught the beta day to day without too many issues (except for it being really slow and heavy at times).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've been far less lucky since&nbsp;Office 2007&nbsp;was released and I installed it on Vista. For some reason I still haven't figured out, Outlook 2007 crashes on me regularly while trying to compose an email (either new or a response to another email). It does not seem to matter if the email is rich text, HTML or text, for that matter. </p>
<p>For example, today it has already crashed three times. Anyone has any ideas as to what may be causing this?</p>
