<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iona.com&#47;blogs&#47;vinoski&#47;">Steve Vinoski</a> reports <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iona.com&#47;blogs&#47;vinoski&#47;archives&#47;000304.html">here</a> on the creation of a Working Group to advance the formalization of a standard spec for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iona.com&#47;opensource&#47;amqp&#47;">Advanced Message Queuing Protocol</a> (AMQP). I think this is pretty interesting: Queuing mechanisms are an extremely powerful and very handy tool for many applications and are a great way to build certain kinds of distributed systems based around messaging. I'm certainly hoping someone will eventually build a .NET implementation of AMQP. Even more interesting would be a BizTalk adapter or, why not, a WCF channel for it. <br>
