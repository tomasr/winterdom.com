<p><!--start_raw-->I've always been fascinated by computer fonts. There's a lot to be said for the creativity and the care taken in designing a good, usable font, and some are really beautiful on their own. While browsing around this afternoon, I ran into a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.identifont.com&#47;free-fonts.html">page listing</a> some fonts available for free, some of which struck my interest. For example, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scripts.sil.org&#47;cms&#47;scripts&#47;page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=Gentium">Gentium</a> looks pretty good to me, even though I'm not usually a fan of serif fonts. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fonts.info&#47;fontstore&#47;product_info.php?cPath=21_46&amp;products_id=34">Agendia Std</a> looks rather different, more usable for headlines and such, but it's certainly a pretty design. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fontsite.com&#47;Pages&#47;FFDownloads.html">Goudy Sans</a> looks pretty as well. <br>Two fonts very usable for headlines are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.madtype.net&#47;free.html">Environ</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.identifont.com&#47;show?E6L">Hattrick SC</a>, which looks very pretty (the website didn't seem to want to open, though).<br>
