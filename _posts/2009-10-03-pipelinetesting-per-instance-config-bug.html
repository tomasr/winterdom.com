<p>Mark Coleman found a bug in the implementation of Per-Instance Config support in my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;pipelinetesting">PipelineTesting</a> library for BizTalk Server. The problem was related to how the config XML was parsed, and would only manifest itself on certain conditions, depending on how said XML was formatted.</p>
<p>Mark was also gracious enough to propose the fix, which I&rsquo;ve now committed to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;pipelinetesting">PipelineTesting GIT repository</a>, along with a unit test to make sure the problem doesn&rsquo;t come up again. Thanks a lot, Mark!</p></p>
