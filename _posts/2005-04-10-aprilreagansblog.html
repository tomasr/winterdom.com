<p><!--start_raw-->I just noticed that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;aprilr&#47;">April Reagan</a> has got a blog over at blogs.msdn.com. Cool!</p>
<p>April is a program manager in the Visual C++ team, and one of the nicest persons I've ever met. She's been absolutely nice to us VC++ MVPs helping us get enrolled in betas and SDRs and stuff like that.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
