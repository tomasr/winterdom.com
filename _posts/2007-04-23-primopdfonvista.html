<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I noticed last week that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.primopdf.com&#47;">PrimoPDF v3.1</a> was released, which now (finally) works on vista. I tried v3.0 (which I had used in XP before) on Vista after RTM, and it just didn't work because it kept trying to create temporary files in the installation folder.</p>
<p>I installed v3.1 and indeed this one seems to work fine on Vista, which is great cause I was really missing it, and its a great complement to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyId=4D951911-3E7E-4AE6-B059-A2E79ED87041">Office 2007 "Save as PDF" addin</a>.</p>
