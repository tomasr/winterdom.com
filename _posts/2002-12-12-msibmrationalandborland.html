    <p>.net or Eclipse ?</p>
    <p>Rational would like to have a peacefull future but it is involved in big battle between .net and Eclipse. MS and IBM could not accept that the leading provider of development tools be acquired by his ennemy. Development market is a small but strategic market.  Rational leadership could influence large company to use .net and not only Java. This is a good opportunity for MS to reach other than only mid-market company users. Another important figure, is that the total cost to acquire Rational, will be less important than the possible fall of MS value (about 300 Billion) at the stock market.Why ! Because if .net is not a success, MS will drop by 5 to 15%,or even more, which represents from 15 to 45 billion loss. This is a lot more than just 2-3 billion rational stock market value.  Eclipse and .net are new technologies and MS and IBM have invested a lot of money in each of them. The one who buy Rational, win the first battle but not the war ! Happy new very year :)- The first quarter of 2003 will be very interesting.</p>

    <p>I shudder to think that the US government would get involved in a technology companies take over activities. Nothing in the past and existing actions against MS had anything to do with development tools. None of the restrictions imposed on them had anything to do with takeovers. So... it's a long shot to see the govt step in and stop it (on what grounds even?).</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Quite a bit of sources mentioning the possible lookout of MS to acquire <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rational.com&#47;">Rational</a> or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.borland.com&#47;">Borland</a>. Not that I'm excited about the prospect, since I've found Rational products to be quite a disappointement, particularly Rational Rose, which was as bad as they came.</p>
<p>I'm surprised, though, that I haven't seen anyone mention the fact that Borland signed an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.togethersoft.com&#47;news&#47;archive&#47;2002&#47;press_releases&#47;103002.jsp">agreement</a> to buy <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.togethersoft.com&#47;">Together Software</a> earlier this year. Doesn't matter much, anyway, since I doubt the US goverment would allow a possible MS bid on Borland to go through...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
