    Have you tried adding a USB Drive and using the new ReadyBoost feature? It's supposed to speed everything with intermediate memory.

    Actually, I hadn't tested it before! I tried it a bit using an empty 256MB drive I had laying around (don't have any bigger) and it did seem to become a little bit more responsive. We'll see how it goes...

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>While doing some work a couple of days ago I went though the installation of the Vista RC1 build on my older laptop, a Compaq Presario 2800&nbsp;(yes, an old beast).&nbsp;Mostly it was click, click, wait a lot, so it didn't interrupt me at all. </p>
<p>My installation experience was far better than <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog&#47;DiaryOfAVistaRC1InstallUpgradingMyMainMachineToWindowsVistaRC1.aspx">Scott's</a>, though that might have been only because I did a clean install and not an upgrade (I <em>never</em> do an upgrade of windows; ever). The install went fine, and was faily painless; taking about 1 hour total. </p>
<p>That said, Vista is pretty much horrendous on this machine. It runs, but is very slow: lots of paging and disk activity going on. Also, since it has a very old Mobility Radeon 7500 chip, which pretty much has no graphics acceleration support on Vista (heck, it will BSOD just trying to run the&nbsp;Performance Rating thingie), the whole UI feels fairly sluggish. That said, it's good enough to play Mahjong, which I think might just be my favorite vista feature so far :-)</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll get some time on the weekend to try it on my main laptop and see if at least this time video works as it is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;07&#47;23&#47;Vista5472NotSoGood.aspx">supposed to</a>.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
