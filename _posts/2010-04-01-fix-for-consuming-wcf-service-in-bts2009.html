<p>It has been brought to my attention that a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;kb&#47;979153">hotfix</a> has been released for the BizTalk Server 2009 developer tools that should fix the problem I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;problem-consuming-wcf-service-in-biztalk-2009">mentioned a few months</a> ago with referencing WCF services within the same BizTalk project as the orchestration that uses them.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but I thought someone might be interested in it.</p></p>
