    Looks like you're using the Zune theme? If so that is probably the issue of why the visual styles stopped working. See:

    Bryant: Thanks, that's probably it. I could swear it worked before, but maybe I just don't remember correctly :)

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Creating decent WPF applications is definitely&nbsp;hard for someone design-challenged as me. I've been trying to polish a small sample WPF client for a WCF service sample I've been playing with, and this is the best I've managed to come up with:</p>
<p><img height="300" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;ISuckatWPF_11E8A&#47;WpfSample%5B4%5D.png" width="600"> </p>
<p>Ugly, isn't it?</p>
<p>Doesn't quite help the fact that, for some reason, the damn application just stopped using Visual Styles all of a suddent (don't know what's going on yet, but the controls are just not using the visual style anymore). Ohh well.</p>
<div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:e7000fbb-55ee-4e36-bb2b-cfc794993715" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tags&#47;Windows%20Presentation%20Foundation" rel="tag">Windows Presentation Foundation</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tags&#47;WPF" rel="tag">WPF</a></div><!--end_raw--></p>
