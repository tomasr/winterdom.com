<p><!--start_raw-->So here am I on the road again. I'm posting this from my hotel in Bogota (they actually have wireless internet access in every room. Cool!), and if everything goes as planned, I'll be tomorrow night in Redmond, WA, for the second time in two weeks.</p>
<p>This time, I'm attending the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.financialdevelopers.com&#47;fsdevcon04.aspx">Financial Services Developer Conference 2004</a> with my boss.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
