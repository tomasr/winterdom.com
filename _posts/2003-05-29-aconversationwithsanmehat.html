    <p>I read that interview too and San doesn't get it.  His claim that SOAP extensibility is somehow a bad thing makes no sense.  He clearly hasn't spent much time thinking about these technologies.</p>

a post today about an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;webservices.devchannel.org&#47;article.pl?sid=03&#47;05&#47;28&#47;0821232">interview</a> with<br />
San Mehat about .NET and WebServices, which I gave a quick read. My take? San doesn't<br />
quite get it. Object Serialization? Collections? Someone should point him out towards<br />
Doc&#47;Literal vs. RPC&#47;Encoded, XSD, and writing WSDL first.</font><br />
