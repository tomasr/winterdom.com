<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;jdevados&#47;">John Devados</a> announces <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;jdevados&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;08&#47;06&#47;690367.aspx">here</a> the first book in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.architecturejournal.net&#47;">Architecture Journal</a> series: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?familyid=6DD54E09-A5BD-42AB-BE0D-1CF1C580009A&amp;displaylang=en"><i>Dynamic Modeling: Aligning Business and IT</i></a>. His post also includes the foreword. I just downloaded it and skimmed over it and read selected portions of it that caught my eye.<br><br>Pretty interesting stuff and it's great to see the Architecture Journal expanding (I really enjoy the magazine itself). The layout is pretty good, easy on the eyes (and ready to be printed if you are so inclined, from the looks of it). Worth a good look.<br>
