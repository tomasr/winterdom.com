<p><!--start_raw-->It seems <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dotnetremoting.cc&#47;DotNetCentric&#47;2002&#47;04&#47;01.html">Ingo liked</a> my idea about writing a secured TCP channel and has offered to help out. That's pretty cool, as he really knows remoting.</p>
<p>I've decided to start out by writing an MC++ wrapper around WSSPI that exposes the authentication facilities so that we can then build the channel itself using C#.<br />
<br&#47;>How cool is <i>that</i>!</p><br />
