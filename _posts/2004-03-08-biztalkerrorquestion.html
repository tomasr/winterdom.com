<p><!--start_raw-->Does anyone know exactly what one has to do to use fault messages on request&#47;receive ports in BizTalk Server 2004 succesfully without running into a "X2162: must receive before sending a fault message on an implemented port" error at compile time?</p>
<p>(I really don't have to mention at this point that the XLang&#47;S compiler error messages don't appear to be documented anywhere, do I?)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
