    I discovered that as well - very strange restriction on Outlook's part.  However, what you think of gmail imap support probably has a lot to do with what you view as your "source of truth" for your mail.  If you like the idea of your inbox in Outlook looking identical to what it does in the gmail web interface, and you've started using gmail labels instead of outlook folders to sort your mail...then the IMAP support in gmail is pretty cool!
    Every gmail label turns into an imap folder...
    "Stars" in gmail turn into "flags" in Outlook, and vice-versa...
    All very slick.

    Hey Scott, Yeah, it's true that the "cloud inbox" should be the source of truth in this case, but it would still be nice to be able to a) easily backup your PST, just in case the worse happens, and b) be able to carry your state with you when you pave your machine or move to a new one, without having to download all your email again from the server!

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>As everyone and their mothers already know, Google recently started activating IMAP support on Gmail, and it looks like most people seem pretty excited about the announcement. </p>
<p>Now, personally, I seem to get by fairly well just using good old POP3 access, and a few filters on the server and my own custom list of folders on my Outlook PST files where I organize mail I want to keep. It's not exactly elegant, but it's what I'm used to and sort of works, though I'll be the first to admit it is kind of awkward to have some email here and some email there and in different locations.</p>
<p>I've never really used IMAP, but I'm willing to give it a try, who knows, maybe I've been missing out on all the fun! So what do I do? I go into outlook, delete my old Gmail account, and create a new one set up with IMAP.</p>
<p>What is the next thing I notice? For some reason, Outlook 2007 seems to believe that if you choose to use IMAP, you're not worthy of choosing the location of your PST file on disk: the file <em>must</em> be on your Windows profile directory in one of those useless, awfully hidden, un-backupable directories (i.e. C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\...). Isn't this an extremely silly restriction to have on a mature, v12 product?</p>
