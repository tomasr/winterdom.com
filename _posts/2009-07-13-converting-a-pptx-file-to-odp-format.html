<p>I had a PowerPoint 2007 presentation this morning that I needed to convert into the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> Presentation format, to make it usable in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openoffice.org&#47;">OpenOffice</a> 3.0. It was a fairly simple presentation, with no animations or anything, just text and some figures.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to simply use the PPTX importer in Impress, and ended up with mixed results. While the presentation was readable, it had a bunch of things that were not quite right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullets were missing (or used the wrong kind)</li>
<li>Images in the master slide background had borders around them</li>
<li>Titles were the wrong color</li> </ul>
<p>Being lazy, I looked around for another option, and remembered that Office 2007 SP1 included some functionality to export documents in OpenDocument format. I decided to give it a try and went into PowerPoint 2007, and executed the Save As &ndash;> OpenDocument Presentation command.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the results, which were pretty much perfect, except for a couple minor differences due to font size. Definitely much better than I expected, and better than OpenOffice itself did. Not bad!</p></p>
