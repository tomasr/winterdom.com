<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pocketsoap.com&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;05&#47;21.html#a535">Simon answers</a> my earlier question (thanks!). I think it sounds awfully cool, and definitely makes sense if one considers the messaging vs. RPC issue that has been beaten to death recently.</p>
<p>However, Simon's answer poses another question: <i>Why is SOAP the format&#47;protocol to use with these kinds of transports?</i> I just gotta wonder why SOAP would be the wire format of choice over [reliable] mechanisms such as MSMQ&#47;JMS, versus, say, other XML based formats, given SOAP's complexity in some areas...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
