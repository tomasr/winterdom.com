    <p>... people begin to see the bright light ... and perhaps we will eventually no longer need WSDL by itself ...?<br &#47;>

    <p>I think that WSDL isn't enough supported by ASP.NET. Just simple thinks (demos) can be done easly, but when you run on enterprise services you have to type everything with notepad !<br &#47;>
    Must be improved....</p>

<p>
<font size="2">I used to think that WSDL was very complex. I'm not quite sure anymore.<br />
Once I understood some key concepts, things started to make sense, in that sort of<br />
Kafkaesque sort of way. I'm talking about things like Abstract WSDL vs. Concrete WSDL. </font><br />
</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="2">There are a few reasons I think WSDL appears so complex when you first<br />
approach it:<br &#47;><br />
WSDL is usually generated by tools; and those tools generate awfully lengthy and complex-seeming<br />
WSDL documents. That hides the basic truths of WSDL behind a shroud of mistery. That<br />
ain't good.</font><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<font size="2">The reason most WSDL documents are so complex is not that the basic<br />
building blocks themselves are complex, but rather that most of the document is spent<br />
describing (and usually re-describing) the message schema used by the defined operations.</font><br />
</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>
<font size="2">Now, let's not kid ourselves. XSD can be both daunting and pretty "chatty"<br />
(as in XSD descriptions can be pretty lengthy even for simple definitions). And by<br />
virtue of this, it can make any WSDL document with inline schema definitions seem<br />
daunting and chatty too!</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">So let me start my own little possee here and cry: Say No to inline<br />
schema definitions in WSDL! Import is your friend....</font><br />
