    retreive tect for this error. Reason:1815\r\nDatabase ... does not exist. Make
    sure that the name is entered correctly.\r\n\r\nbut the mdf is in the correct
    place and name. Can you help me?"

  content: "Davi: Sorry, I didn't actually install the repository as I didn't have
    SQL2K8 on that machine, so not sure what might be happening.\r\n\r\nWhat SQL server
    version do you have installed? Express?\r\n\r\nIn any case, error 5 is usually
    Access Denied. It might simply be that the account running the SQL Server service
    doesn't have read&#47;write access to the folder the MDF is located in."

  content: Thanks Tomas... That was exactly the problem.  We need to provide access
    to Application Data folder (inside Documents and Settings\) of user used to run
    Quadrant for the sql server user.

<p>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyID=827122a5-3ca0-4389-a79e-87af37cbf60d&amp;displaylang=en">May 2009 CTP</a> drop of the Microsoft <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;oslo&#47;default.aspx">Oslo</a> SDK was released today. I was just installing it to check out what&rsquo;s new, and thought it was a bit funny how Oslo&rsquo;s minimalistic UI design extends all the way to the CTP installation program:</p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="oslo_sdk_install" border="0" alt="oslo_sdk_install" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;oslo-sdk-install.png" width="590" height="435" &#47;></p></p>
