<p><!--start_raw-->While commenting on an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;dotnetguy&#47;2002&#47;06&#47;18.aspx#a207">entry</a> in Brad's blog, I said that I'd be interested in working on the CVS tasks for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nant.sf.net&#47;">NAnt</a>.</p>
<p>Problem is, I don't really have much free time to do so, nor am I a CVS expert, and I've already got my hands full working on midl and sql tasks. Fortunately, Bernard Vander Beken wrote me and mentioned he'd like to help out with it, which would be great! Thanks Bernard!</p> <!--end_raw--></p>
