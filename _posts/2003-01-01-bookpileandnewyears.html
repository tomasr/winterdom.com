<p><!--start_raw-->I love books. Right now, my bookshelf hosts a very nice "to-read" 11-book-tall pile. Is there anything better than the feel and smell of a brand new book?</p>
<p>One of my new year's resolution is opening up to new paradigms and environments, and learning more about scripting. So, today I started reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;lperl3&#47;">"Learning Perl"</a>, and so far, I'm liking it. Next in the back burner is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;python2&#47;">"Programming Python"</a>.</p></p>
<p>Happy new year, everyone!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
