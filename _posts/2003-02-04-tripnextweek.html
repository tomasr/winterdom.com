<p><!--start_raw-->I guess this is as good a time as any other to announce I'll be all next week out of town.</p>
<p>I'll be arriving in Seattle on Saturday night, and leaving Friday at midnight. If anyone's in the area (and I believe a few of you guys will be), and cares to meet even for just a cup of coffe, let <a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">me know</a>. I'd love to chat for a while!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
