<p><!--start_raw-->So far, I've refrained myself from talking about Indigo in any specific way. Why? Well, basicly because I know next-to-nothing about indigo, not having written a single service using it ever (not surprising, given the lack of public builds of indigo and not being one of the privileged few with access to it [1]).</p>
<p>That said, let me just say one thing about Indigo: I don't really care <i>all that much</i> about Indigo supporting X or Y specification (but yes, it makes me feel tingly inside as well). What I <i>do</i> care quite a bit about is the programming model Indigo should bring to the table, since so far, it sounds like something I could feel much more comfortable with.</p></p>
<p>So yes, count me as yet another soul looking forward to the Indigo beta builds :)</p></p>
<p>[1] The longhorn previews builds don't count, don't have a machine I could ever run it in :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
