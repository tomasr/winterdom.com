    I don't think I've ever seen Envy Code R look so beautiful. Is this your tweaked Linux&#47;FreeType configuration?

    Yep! That's the one. It looks great, even though I'm using huge font sizes (can't read anything unless I do that on the laptop's 1920x1200 screen :)). I love it!

    Very cool to see you are using GVIM for Powershell scripting. Syntax highlighting using Peter Norvost's plugins works great. I use the vibrantink color scheme myself. Your scheme is pretty cool too.
    Curious though....do you have omnifunc (auto-completion) working? If so, how? I think it would be very cool to have powertab like auto-completion for powershell scripts. Using the VIM supertab plugin, I have it working for everything but powershell scripts. When I try to use it, it says something to the effect of omnifunc is not set (but as I mentioned, I only see this for .PS1 files).

    @CK: I do not use omni-completion. The regular workd-based completion works pretty well, though.

    that I am using it successfully in a 256-colour environment. It prompted me to
    do a complete overhaul of my graphical terminal colours after many years of the
    same 8&#47;16-colour theme. I've simply never bothered with 256 colours because
    they always seemed to be lacking something somewhere. But Molokai is one hell
    of a job -- it appears our tastes match ;)\r\n\r\nScreenshot: http:&#47;&#47;imgbin.org&#47;images&#47;13078.png"

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted an update for my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;12&#47;MolokaiForVim.aspx">Molokai</a> color scheme for Vim that now supports the terminal version of Vim on terminals capable of displaying 256 colors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use the terminal version of Vim as often as GVim, but it is still occasionally useful, and I hated having to use two different color schemes; one on the GUI version and one on the terminal.</p>
<p>Of course, both are not exactly the same, since the terminal capabilities are still restricted, but they look fairly similar. The following screenshot shows GVim (left) and Vim on gnome-terminal (right) running side by side with the new molokai version:</p>

<p>You can get the updated script from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org&#47;scripts&#47;script.php?script_id=2340">Vim site</a> or from my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;dotfiles&#47;tree&#47;master&#47;.vim&#47;colors&#47;molokai.vim">dotfiles repository</a> at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;">GitHub</a>.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
