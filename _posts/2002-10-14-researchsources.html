<p><!--start_raw-->Peter's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.razorsoft.net&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;10&#47;04.html">mention</a> of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;murl.microsoft.com&#47;default.asp">Multi University&#47;Research Laboratory Seminar Series</a> reminded me of the tools I liked using when researching things around back in college (well, I still use them, even though I have no current academic interest :)). Anyway, my two favourites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;portal.acm.org&#47;portal.cfm">ACM Portal</a> to the ACM digital library and guides. I've found my ACM membership in the past couple of years a blessing... it's a wonderful resource (well, at least if you learn to use it...)</li>
<li>NEC's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;citeseer.nj.nec.com&#47;cs">CiteSeer</a>. This one is really a gold mine of bibliographic information, full text search, and tons of complete articles in a huge number of topics.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p><b>P.S.</b>: I know I probably should've included the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.computer.org&#47;">IEEE Computer Society</a> in this listing, but, alas, I'm not a member of the society (they do have some draconian joining rules at some levels).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
