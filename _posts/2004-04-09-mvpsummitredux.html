<p><!--start_raw-->I spent all week in Seattle&#47;Redmond at the Global MVP Summit. It was a blast.</p>
<p>On Saturday, got to finally meet my friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.samgentile.com&#47;blog&#47;">Sam Gentile</a> Face to Face after all this time and had <a href="http:&#47;&#47;samgentile.com&#47;blog&#47;archive&#47;2004&#47;04&#47;04&#47;11416.aspx">dinner</a> with him and a few other guys.</p></p>
<p>On Monday, had a blast at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jillians.com&#47;club_detail.asp?club_id=7">Jillian's</a> with the VC++ team and the rest of the VC++ MVPs</p></p>
<p>On Wednesday, I went to dinner alongside <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.honestillusion.com&#47;">James Curran</a>, Carl Daniel, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winwonk.com&#47;">Kim Gr&auml;sman</a> and someone else whose name I can't quite remember now...(all VC++ MVPs). We looked around for a while, and ended up on this really nice place called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cuisinenet.com&#47;info&#47;rstrnt-283385&#47;?&amp;t=1671">The Pink Door</a>; located close to Pike's Market. It had great ambient, great food, and the company was superb.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
