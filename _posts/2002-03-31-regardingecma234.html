<p><!--start_raw-->Regarding <b>ECMA-234</b>, Richard Birkby was kind enough to mention this:<br&#47;><br />
"IIRC, this was an attempt by Sun and others to prevent Windows 95 (and hence<br />
Win32) becoming popular. You see, they had created WABI (Windows Application<br />
Binary Interface) for emulating the Windows API on Unix (think WINE). But,<br />
it only supported Win16. So obviously, if every application became 32 bit,<br />
Sun would have to put a lot of resources into updating WABI.<br&#47;><br />
Their approach was to attempt to standardize the Win16 API hoping this would<br />
stall Microsoft..."<!--end_raw--></p>
