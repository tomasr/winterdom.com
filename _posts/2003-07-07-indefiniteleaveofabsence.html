<blockquote>
<div>For various personal reasons, I have decided to take an leave of absence from<br />
blogging (as well as reading other blogs), mailing lists, the .NET scene (but not<br />
work), and speaking engagements (including INETA) for an indefinite period of time.<br />
I thank all my loyal readers and many friends for all their support.<br &#47;><br />

<div><font size="2">I'm so sorry to hear this. Not only because Sam's a great contributor<br />
to this little community of ours, but also because I feel I've failed Sam, at least<br />
to&#160;some degree.... I just haven't been there for him in the last couple of months<br />
and we have barely spoken in this time.... I guess we both have been just way too<br />
busy (at least I know I've been, and I know Sam always is), but I feel it is a shame,<br />
as Sam has been one of the best friends I've ever come across. I sincerely hope we<br />
can get on track again....</font><br />
