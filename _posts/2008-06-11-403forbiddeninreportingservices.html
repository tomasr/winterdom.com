    Thanks, I spent considerable time on this.
    One of my servers work without requiring this addition, but another won't work until I added this. Not sure why, and not sure of the implications, but for now it's working for me.

  content: Totally amazing fix that belies belief, but nonetheless, it solved the
    403 error I was receiving on the second run of replicating an ASP&#47;SSRS application.
    The first run worked fine without the addition of this file, the second would
    not render a report because of this error. Adding this file into the Documents
    section did the trick.

<p>I just spent a good chunk of time fighting a problem with my SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services installation. I had not previously used it on this machine so it should've been exactly as the SQL Server (and SP2) installation program configured it.</p>
<p>I started by deploying a new set of reports from Visual Studio over to the server, which worked straight away. I then went to the Web-based Report manager and could see my reports deployed, but as soon as I tried actually rendering one of the reports, I'd get an error like this one:</p>
<div class="codebg"><code>Remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden</code></div>
<p>Long story short, the problem was in how the &#47;Reports application references the services in the &#47;ReportServer application, and I fixed it by going to IIS and modifying the &#47;ReportServer application configuration to add "ReportService2005.asmx" as a possible default content page under the "Documents" tab of the application's property page.</p>
<div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:69791478-efe1-4d1a-a9cb-399cd2320a0b" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tags&#47;SQL%20Server%20Reporting%20Services" rel="tag">SQL Server Reporting Services</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tags&#47;SSRS" rel="tag">SSRS</a></div><!--end_raw--></p>
