<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Book two in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.architecturejournal.net&#47;">Architecture Journal</a> series is now out: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;architecture&#47;default.aspx?pull=&#47;library&#47;en-us&#47;dnbda&#47;html&#47;rdsrvort.asp">Readings in Service Orientation</a>, which you can download from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyID=4469946F-2723-47A2-9F54-6520DDAE3260&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>. Plenty of good stuff to read, though I was surprised to see that several of the included articles are about Software Factories and not quite about Service Orientation per se.</p>
<p>A lot of excellent material brought together, though, and well worth reading all in all.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
