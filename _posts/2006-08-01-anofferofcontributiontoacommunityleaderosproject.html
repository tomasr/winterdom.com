    I would like to nominate Rockford Lhotka's CSLA Framework which is available at http:&#47;&#47;www.lhotka.net&#47;cslanet&#47;
    Although he probably does not need the subscription. However there is a related community site that could benefit I imagine.
    Cheers,
    Bob Porter

    AnkhSvn... The better this SVN plugin gets, the more people we will help moving out of VSS. VS.NET developers are too spoiled to use TortoiseSVN.

    @Sergio:
    Would you especify a particular member of the AnkhSVN team that deserves it in particular?

<p><!--start_raw-->In the email Kevin Downs sent to the NDoc community (as posted by Charles C. Chen <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.charliedigital.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,95b2ab68-ba92-413a-b758-2783cde5df9c.aspx">here</a>), he mentioned that "<i>In fact, were it not for Oleg Tkachenko&rsquo;s kind donation of a MS MVP<br />
MSDN subscription, I would not even have a copy of VS2005 to work with!".</i> I think this is a sad state of affairs.<br><br>So what I'd like to do is extend an offer for a similar contribution to a leader or significant participant of an community project in the .NET and general Microsoft developer community, by giving away my last MVP Invite card for an MSDN Subscription!<br><br>So, what I'd like is for you, my dilligent reader, to nominate whoever you think most needs and deserves this. Just leave a comment on this post or <a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">send me</a> an email. Be sure to mention why you think they deserve it the most :) I'll take it into consideration and later announce the winner on this blog!<br><br><b>Update (2006-08-09): </b><i>Come'on people! I need more candidates! Keep'em coming!</i><br><i></i>
