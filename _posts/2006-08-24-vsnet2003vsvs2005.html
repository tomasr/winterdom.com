<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've been doing some work lately on Visual Studio .NET 2003, after a long while of working with Visual Studio 2005. I've been really missing the .NET 2.0 features like generics and the like, but what really knocked me out was the speed. </p>
<p>I use to think that VS.NET 2003 was a pretty slow beast, but wow, compared to Visual Studio 2005, it is light as a feather. I'm guessing having the full Team Suite edition with all the BizTalk Server 2006 and SQL Server 2005 tools installed into devenv doesn't really help, either...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
