<p><!--start_raw-->A couple of days ago I started seeing this error when trying to invoke ServicedComponents built with the .NET framework v1.1 on my machine, with no clue why this was happening. I eventually was able to trace the issue and found it got fixed by running regasm.exe on System.EnterpriseServices.dll again :(</p>
<p>I can only presume this got screwed up when I uninstalled one of the Vhidbey CTPs and installed the november one, which kinda sucks, but it is to be expected from running unreleased software.</p></p>
<p>P.S: I still seem to be having problems calling IDisposable::Dipose() on ServicedComponents, though, but running regasm on mscorlib.dll didn't seem to fix it :(</p><!--end_raw--></p>
