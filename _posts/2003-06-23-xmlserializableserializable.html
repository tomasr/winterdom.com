    <p>This 'feature' (the dataset not being marked as serializable) has caused me pain as well.  </p>
    <p>What was your work around?</p>

    <p>So far, none... Perhaps I'll just write a small script to add them, I don't know...</p>

<font size="2">One thing that has been bugging me about XSD.EXE lately is the fact<br />
that when using it to generate typed classes from an XSD (with the &#47;c switch), the<br />
generated classes won't also be marked as [Serializable]. I've been trying to come<br />
up with a case where an XmlSerializable class generated by XSD.EXE wouldn't also be<br />
potentially Remoting-Serializable, but have come emptu handed. Any examples?</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">Granted, this is not the focus of the tool, but I think it would be<br />
fairly useful and not too troublesome. Anyone cares to agree&#47;disagree?</font><br />
