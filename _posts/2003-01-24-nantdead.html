    <p>Hey, Tomas, like I said, wasn't trying to pick on you guys in particular (and if I was *really* worked up, well, I'd volunteer to help, wouldn't I? ;-), and I certainly never said the project was dead.  Just that it hasn't been publicly versioned in a long time, and that was not unusual for .NET open source initiatives.  And THAT was really my point.  Sorry -- I'll make special note of that on my blog.</p>

    NAnt appears to be falling behind the times with lack of full framework support. From what I've seen in the industry, people are abandoning open source products in favor of horribly overpriced commercial solutions because of shortcommings like this.

<p><!--start_raw-->Justin Gehtland <a href="http:&#47;&#47;staff.develop.com&#47;gehtland&#47;archives&#47;00000003.html">seems to think</a> that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nant.sf.net&#47;">NAnt</a> is dead, because no new releases have been done since June last year. He's right about us not having done any new releases, but not because the project is dead, at all! NAnt has matured quite a bit, and certainly a release is overdue... but work and fixes on NAnt continues.</p>
<p>Granted, perhars it is not being developed at the speed at which it began originally, but that's not necessarily bad. Since the last <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mail-archive.com&#47;nant-developers@lists.sourceforge.net&#47;msg00563.html">big refactoring</a>, NAnt's core has been fairly stable, which is good. Anyway, Justin, if you don't believe me, feel free to get around our <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;mailarchive&#47;forum.php?forum_id=863">mail list</a> and take a look for yourself :)</p><br />
