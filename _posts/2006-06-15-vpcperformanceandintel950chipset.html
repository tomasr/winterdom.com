<p><!--start_raw-->Lately, I've been getting a little fed up with the poor performance I was getting out of my virtual machines in Virtual PC 2004 (which I still prefer compared to using Virtual Server 2005 R2 directly). Performance was particularly bad on VPC image with SQL Server 2005, which has a nasty tendency of constantly using the processor and eating a lot of memory even when it's not being used (and BizTalk 2006 somewhat aggravates the issue). I've obviously done the common things like defragging the disk.<br><br>While looking for clues as to what the problem might be, I ran into KB article <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;899525">899525 "When you run Virtual PC 2004 on a portable computer that uses the Intel Centrino 950 chipset, Virtual PC Performance is reduced"</a>. As it turns out, my laptop does indeed use the 950 chipset, so I thought this might be one of the issues I was running into and proceeded to call PSS and ask for the hotfix. <br><br>After I installed the hotfix and restarted my virtual machines, I noticed that performance improved quite a bit inside the guest OS: SQL Workbench and Visual Studio 2005 seemed more responsive, and overall the machine felt just better. Unfortunately, this seems to have had a nasty side effect: Now Virtual PC will hog down 100% of the real machine's CPU time when a virtual machine is running, <i>even</i> if the machine is paused! <br><br>I'm not sure if this will be an acceptable compromise yet, will keep trying and see if I can improve things somewhat.<br>
