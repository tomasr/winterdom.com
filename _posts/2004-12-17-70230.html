<p><!--start_raw-->The inevitable happened, I guess. After years of putting it off, I finally took my first MCP exam. The victim? 70-230 "Designing and Implementing Solutions with Microsoft BizTalk Server 2000, Enterprise Edition". Old, but certainly more entertaining than doing C# exams :)</p>
<p>At least I passed the exam ;)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
