<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I got a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wii.com&#47;">Nintendo Wii</a> for christmas today. Now, I've always loved gaming and consoles, but for some reason, my last console was a NES (yep, that long ago!). I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the new Wii controller, but I have to admit it is actually far better than it looks, and is&nbsp;far more&nbsp;comfortable than I expected. </p>
<p>I also got a copy of Zelda Princess of Twillight and spent a few hours playing it. Very cool game, and I've always been a fan of the Zelda games (back to the original NES one) so by far this was the title that I was more interested in. It has a few tricky parts at the beginning that are not very intuitive, but the game play is plenty of fun and I've had a great time so far.</p>
<p>Happy holidays every one!</p>
