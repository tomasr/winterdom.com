<p><!--start_raw-->Well, as many others have reported, the new names for Indigo and Avalon have been chosen: Windows Communications Framework and Windows Presentation Framework, respectively.</p>
<p>Not to pick on you guys but for such cool and exciting products to get such <i>uninspiring</i> names is just a shame. Besides this, who in their right mind is going to guess that Windows Communications Framework is anything even remotely related to WebServices or Service Orientation?</p></p>
<p>Somehow, telling people that you're creating a "Windows Communications Framework" application doesn't sound too hot, does it? ;)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
