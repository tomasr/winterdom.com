<p><!--start_raw-->So Peter  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.razorsoft.net&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;04&#47;23.html#a146">responds</a> to my<br />
<a href="&#47;weblog&#47;default.aspx?2002_04_21_archive.html#75710391">earlier<br />
question</a> on his MC++ comments.  You know what? I completely agree with him. MC++ is<br />
<i>extremely</i> cool, but it also can be a complete drag to use if you're not already pretty<br />
well versed in both your C++ <i>and</i> and way .NET works.</p>
<p>But I'm also confident things will change in the future as more people come to realize<br />
they want (or need) the extra power and flexibility offered by MC++. And I'm also very excited<br />
about the commitment the VC++ team at Microsoft have shown to the language and wanting to improve the<br />
situation.</p><br />
