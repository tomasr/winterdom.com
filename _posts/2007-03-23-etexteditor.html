<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>After my past <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;05&#47;TextEditors.aspx">couple</a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;06&#47;MoreTextEditors.aspx">posts</a> on Text Editors (which&nbsp;turned out to be fairly popular by the way), quite a few people suggested I tried <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.e-texteditor.com&#47;">e-TextEditor</a>. I had already mentioned that I knew about it but had not actually tried it, so I decided to give it a quick spin to the trial download today and see how I liked it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, here's how e-TextEditor looks on my development Virtual Machine:</p>
<p><img height="611" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;eTextEditor_CDF2&#47;eTextEditor%5B12%5D.png" width="701"> </p>
<p>Yep. The editing window never gets fully repainted so I just stare at the background all the time. Well, actually I can see the caret blink and move around when I type, but that's about it. </p>
<p>Hard to try it when you can't see what you type in it, but hopefully it is just a funky bug that will get fixed in a future beta. I did look around the&nbsp;support forums a bit but didn't see anything too obvious that looked like my problem.&nbsp;I'll look at it again&nbsp;later on when&nbsp;perhaps the problem has been corrected.&nbsp;</p>
