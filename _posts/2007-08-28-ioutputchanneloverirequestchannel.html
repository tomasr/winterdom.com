    I've tried this and it doesn't work for me over BasicHttp (I haven't checked the rest). The exception that I get is "System.Net.HttpListenerException: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process..."
    Any ideas?

    Udi:
    The code I posted sure works for a *client*-side channel (I tested it, and I'd be happy to send you the sample code if you want it). I'm curious, though, are you trying to create this way a *server*-side channel? Otherwise, HttpListener shouldn't get involved at all!
    If you don't mind sharing some code, I'd be happy to take a look at...

    Oh, I see. I'm looking for server-side channels. That's why it isn't working for me.

    Udi: Any reason why you need to manipulate the stack at the channel level on the receive side? Sounds to me like it's easier to just use a generic one-way service contract with a catch-all operation and let ServiceHost do its thing normally; but if you can clarify your needs, I'm sure we can find something more suited to them.

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;udidahan.weblogs.us&#47;">Udi Dahan</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;udidahan.weblogs.us&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;28&#47;ioutputchannel-and-irequestchannel-more-wcf-angst&#47;">ranted a bit</a> about the WCF transport channel model and it's extensive use of generics. More to the point, Udi was running into some trouble trying to simply send a message, one way, over an arbitrary transport channel that could either be one way or not. The problem he runs into is dealing in a generic fashion with the different <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;drnick&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;03&#47;07&#47;544724.aspx">Channel Shapes</a> that WCF exposes.</p>
<p>I commented on his blog that maybe it would be possible for him to use a custom binding and using the OneWayBindingElement binding element to "change" the shape of the underlying, two-way channel into a single-way channel he could use by just coding against the IOutputChannel interface. Udi responsed:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>"I&rsquo;m trying to write transports for NServiceBus which will make use of the WCF bindings. So, since BasicHttpBinding only supports IRequestChannel and not IOutputChannel I have to deal with this. It&rsquo;s just nuts that there isn&rsquo;t some more useful shared interface between them."&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>From his description, I gather that Udi is (with good intentions of keeping things simple) equating channels with standard bindings, but this isn't quite so. The BasicHttpBinding is just a binding; not a channel itself. However, this standard&nbsp;binding will certainly force a matched two-way channel shape (IRequestChannel) based on the underlying transport channel used (HttpTransportChannel&#47;HttpsTransportChannel). </p>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong about creating a new binding that is based on one of the standard channels but has extra binding elements layered on top. Here's a sample:</p>
<pre>EndpointAddress epa =<br />
<span style="color: blue">new</span> EndpointAddress(<span style="color: maroon">"http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8254&#47;myservice&#47;myserv.svc"</span>);<br />
WSHttpBinding wsHttp = <span style="color: blue">new</span> WSHttpBinding(SecurityMode.None, <span style="color: maroon">false</span>);<br />
CustomBinding binding = CreateOneWayBinding(wsHttp);<br />
<span style="color: green">&#47;&#47; could also be</span><br />
<span style="color: green">&#47;&#47; CreateOneWayBinding(new BasicHttpBinding());</span><br />
IChannelFactory<IOutputChannel> factory =<br />
binding.BuildChannelFactory<IOutputChannel>();<br />
factory.Open();<br />
IOutputChannel channel = factory.CreateChannel(epa);<br />
Message myMessage = Message.CreateMessage(<br />
binding.MessageVersion, <span style="color: maroon">"Process"</span>, <span style="color: maroon">"some sample contents"</span><br />
);<br />
channel.Open();<br />
channel.Send(myMessage);<br />
channel.Close();<br />
factory.Close();</pre></p>
<p>The CreateOneWayBinding() method used in the sample above is fairly simple:</p>
<pre><span style="color: blue">static</span> CustomBinding CreateOneWayBinding(Binding baseBinding)<br />
{<br />
List<BindingElement> elems = <span style="color: blue">new</span> List<BindingElement>();<br />
elems.Add(<span style="color: blue">new</span> OneWayBindingElement());<br />
elems.AddRange(baseBinding.CreateBindingElements());<br />
<span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">new</span> CustomBinding(elems);<br />
}</pre></p>
<p>It basically creates a new CustomBinding based on the binding elements of the original binding (in this case one of the standard ones) and then layers the OneWayBindingElement, channel shape changing element on top. </p></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;For some reason, this would not work if message security was enabled with the WSHttpBinding, but I didn't spent too much time looking at what the issue was, but otherwise works fine with the WSHttpBinding, BasicHttpBinding and NetTcpBinding, which is enough to make it useful on its own.</p></p>
