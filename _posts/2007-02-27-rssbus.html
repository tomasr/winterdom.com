<p>If you're interested in using RSS to do more than simply publishing your blog, like taking advantage of it to integrate your applications, then you ought to&nbsp;take a look at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nsoftware.com&#47;">&#47;n software</a>'s <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rssbus.com&#47;">RSSBus</a> platform, which recently reached Beta 4. It's a really cool&nbsp;piece of technology&nbsp;with lots of connectors and the best part is that extending it is incredibly easy. </p>
<p>Basically, RSSBus provides a way to create connectors that generate RSS feeds with whatever you like (from bringing in a real RSS feed from another site, to keeping track of the most recently updated customer contacts in your CRM), and then provides a simple scripting language that allows you to manipulate those feeds in whatever way you like. The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rssbus.com&#47;docs&#47;rssbus.aspx">introduction whitepaper</a> tells it best, so go check it out.</p>
<p>And speaking of BizTalk adapters, it's worth noting as well that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nsoftware.com&#47;">&#47;n software</a> released back in October Version 2.0 of their <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nsoftware.com&#47;products&#47;biztalk&#47;">BizTalk Server Adapter Suite</a>, which includes AS2, Secure FTP (SFTP and FTPS), RSS, SSH, Secure SMTP&#47;POP&#47;IMAP, SMPP, SNPP, XMPP adapters and more. Lots of good stuff here. Somehow I had missed on reporting this one!</p>
