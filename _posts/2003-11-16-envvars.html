<p><!--start_raw-->Craig Andera comments <a href="http:&#47;&#47;staff.develop.com&#47;candera&#47;weblog2&#47;PermaLink.aspx&#47;0eb256dc-809c-47ce-89ae-489a416509b1">here</a> on the use of environment variables. I use a technique similar to his, except I don't use no stinking registry key ;).</p>
<p>Instead, what I have is a set of batch files that set the environment as I like it, one for each version of VS.NET installed on my machine (3, at this time), and have a shortcut to each one on my quicklaunch bar (it's easy to do using the cmd.exe's &#47;k switch). This gives me both all the things I need at the command line, and an easy way to support multiple build environments at the same time :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
