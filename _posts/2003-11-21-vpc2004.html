<p><!--start_raw-->Earlier this week I upgraded to Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 from VPC 5.2. Looks pretty nice, and seems to be working fine. In fact, networking finally works right for me, so that by itself is a huge improvement!</p>
<p>A few months ago, I reported about a <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000327.html">conflict</a> between VPC 5.2 and Outlook 2003. Well, with 2004, it seemed to be gone. Virtual machines start up with no problems when outlook is open.</p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem seems to have reversed itself. Now, instead of having VPC hang while the VM is starting up, it hangs when the Virtual Machine is shutting down!!! GRRRR!!!!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
