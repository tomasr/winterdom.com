<p><!--start_raw-->My good friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gecheverry.blogspot.com&#47;">Gustavo Echeverry</a> has started a new blog focused on biztalk and related technologies. One of his initial posts starts by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gecheverry.blogspot.com&#47;2005&#47;12&#47;biztalk-server-interview-answers.html">trying to provide some answers</a> and resources to the excellent BTS Interview questions brought forward by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;geekswithblogs.net&#47;sthomas&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;12&#47;13&#47;63077.aspx">Stephen W Thomas</a>. Way to go!</p>
<p>Carlos Medina has also been quite active lately in the BTS arena both in his own <a href="http:&#47;&#47;biztalkblogs.com&#47;carlosmedina&#47;default.aspx">personal blog</a> as well as contributing to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;biztalklatam&#47;">BizTalk LATAM blog</a> (a great resource for spanish-speaking biztalkers).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
