<p><!--start_raw-->Christian Weyer just <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;cweyer&#47;archive&#47;2004&#47;12&#47;06&#47;275993.aspx">announced</a> the release of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thinktecture.com&#47;Resources&#47;Software&#47;WSContractFirst&#47;default.html">WSCF 0.4</a>. This is very exciting for me, not only because of the new features it brings to the table (the WSDL wizard rocks!), but also because I was lucky enough to be allowed to try early copies of the tool, and immediately saw the great potential it has to improve how we approach our webservices creation process. I wholeheartedly recommend anyone working with ASMX WebServices to give it a spin.</p>
<p>Congrats my friend!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
