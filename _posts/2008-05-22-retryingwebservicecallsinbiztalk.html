<p>BizTalk Server has some pretty strong facilities for making a "best effort" at ensuring message delivery, by using the automatic retry facilities available to BizTalk Send Ports.</p>
<p>This functionality is available when calling Web Services as well either with the WCF or SOAP adapters, and it's very useful. However, it's not always enough by itself.</p>
<p>One such scenario comes up when the Web Service you're calling does not return SOAP Faults when it fails, but instead returns some kind of status&#47;result indicator as part of a normal response message. In that case, the SOAP&#47;WCF adapter can't tell on its own that the service call failed and retry it as necessary.</p>
<p>There are a few ways you can deal with this.</p>
<p>For example, you can handle retries manually from an orchestration, using a Loop shape to call the service, check the result and retry the call as necessary. It's not complex (though a bit cumbersome) and in many scenarios works very well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isn't an option if you are in a messaging-only scenario, or have complex routing rules leading to the service invocation (common with direct-binding scenarios).</p>
<p>One possible workaround for this if you're using the WCF Adapter in R2 that I've been experimenting lately with is to use the WCF-Custom adapter and configure a custom Endpoint Behavior that adds an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.servicemodel.dispatcher.iclientmessageinspector.aspx">IClientMessageInspector</a> implementation that checks the response message and transforms it to a fault if it indicates.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;RetryingWebServiceCallsinBizTalk_12B9B&#47;BTSWCFFault_7.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="260" alt="BTSWCFFault" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;RetryingWebServiceCallsinBizTalk_12B9B&#47;BTSWCFFault_thumb_2.png" width="484" border="0" &#47;></a> </p>
<p>A few things to keep in mind if you decide to try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For your behavior to be listed on the BizTalk Administration console, you'll need to implement a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.servicemodel.configuration.behaviorextensionelement.aspx">BehaviorExtensionElement</a> for it, deploy it to the GAC and register it in machine.config (or at least this was the way I did it). </li>
<li>Inside your <code>IClientMessageInspector.AfterReceiveReply()</code> implementation, you might need to create a buffered copy of the message and return a new Message instance built from it to the WCF Adapter runtime; otherwise BizTalk might not be able read the message because you've already consumed it and it will be in the closed state by then. </li>
<li>Make sure you leave the "Propagate Fault Message" option unchecked; otherwise your fault will just be submitted to BizTalk as a regular message and won't cause the send port to retry the call. </li> </ol>
<p>My friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.devdeo.com&#47;carlos.medina&#47;">Carlos</a> suggested that another way to deal with this issue (particularly if you're not using the WCF adapter) might be by building a custom pipeline component and using it in a receive pipeline configured in the Send Port. The component would then read the response from the Web Service and throw an exception to force a failure during the response processing if necessary, thus causing the entire exchange to fail. I haven't tried this myself, but sounds like another useful idea!</p>
