    <p>Interesting... I have not heard anything about enterprise single sign on from MS, but the timing is coincidental because I'm getting ready to spend my next few months writing a single sign on app for our enterprise.</p>
    <p>I may need to look into this... thanks for the heads up!</p>

<font size="2">I'm somewhat surprised I hadn't heard much talk about Enterprise Single<br />
SignOn, a new service present in a few of the upcoming MS servers, like <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;biztalk&#47;beta&#47;">Biztalk<br />
Server 2004</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;office&#47;preview&#47;sharepoint&#47;default.asp">Sharepoint<br />
Portal Server 2003</a>, I believe.</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">Quite frankly, I'm not sure what to think about it. On one side, the<br />
idea certainly sounds appealing. On the other, can't help but think the potential<br />
for disaster is pretty large. Anyone knows more about this? I'd love to hear people's<br />
thoughts on the idea...</font><br />
