<p><!--start_raw-->Justin <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pinetree-tech.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;2002&#47;08&#47;12.shtml#new_specs">commented</a> yesterday on the new WS specs released a few days ago. He's worried if the actual implementations of those specs from the big players would interop. I, however, am wondering if they'll actually be implemented.</p>
<p>There have been tons of specs released lately, but implementations don't seem to be coming. Take the GXA initial specs, for example: MS is a big pusher in this arena, yet they have yet to show at least a demo implementation of <i>any</i> of the specs. This is just ludicrous.</p></p>
<p>As for WS-Coordination: I read the spec yesterday, and I don't think it's going to be trivial to implement and interop. Also, be warned that WS-Coor is pretty much useless by itself without implementing also at least one Coordination Protocol, like WS-Transaction, which only makes things worse.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
