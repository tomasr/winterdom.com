<p><!--start_raw-->It seems <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pinetree-tech.com&#47;weblog&#47;">Justin Rudd</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.quality.nu&#47;dotnetguy&#47;">Brad Wilson</a> have been <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pinetree-tech.com&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;06&#47;02.html#a75">discussing</a> building a .NET RSS aggregator and blogging tool. Cool. We've discussed this topic in the past in Brad's forum, and it's certainly one I'd love to help with if they decide to open it out by any chance...</p>
<p>I currently use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bitworking.org&#47;Aggie.html">Aggie</a>, and it works for my basic needs, but I'd certainly like something better, and I'd love something ASP.NET-based ;). I have to admit, though, that I find Aggie's default rendering template downright ugly! Sorry, Joe!</p></p>
<p>So if <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bitworking.org&#47;">Joe</a> doesn't mind, I'll post the template I built based on his original template in a couple of days... Who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful!</p><br />
