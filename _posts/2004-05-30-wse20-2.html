<p><!--start_raw-->As everybody knows, WSE 2.0 was released last week. One thing I find myself wishing for was to be able to use Simon's excellent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pocketsoap.com&#47;tcptrace">TcpTrace</a> with the TCP Transport in WSE. Alas, WSE doesn't like it when the reply endpoint is on a different port than the request (it's possibly comparing the two endpoint URLs, atlhough I haven't dug into it) :(</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> A few hours after posting this, my good friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;cweyer&#47;">Christian Weyer</a> sent me an email mentioning that this indeed can be made to work, by simply taking advantage of the routing facilities and inserting a Via element in the endpoint reference that points to the port TcpTrace is listening on from the client side! Way cool! Thanks Christian! :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
