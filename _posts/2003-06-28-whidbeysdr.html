<font size="2">It seems a few people were last week at the Whidbey SDR in Redmond.<br />
Cool. Now my question is: What is the focus of such an SDR? Now, I'm not asking for<br />
what was specifically said during the SDR; I'm just curious whether what kinds of<br />
things where covered in the SDR that's not somehow already covered by the SDRs the<br />
individual teams in the suite already do... (unless, this SDR was not about VS.NET<br />
per se, but rather the framework, in which case I supose it'd be understandable).</font><br />
