"</i>.</p>
<p>I second that. I'm already subscribed to 7 mailing lists or so, plus a fairly large set of newsgroups. It gets awfully hard sometimes to handle it all...</p></p>
<p><b>P.S.</b>: I've been missing the dotnet lists this week, as my main machine is down (still haven't found exactly what's wrong with it), which is where I keep my mail. Fortunately, I didn't loose any information, but it's handling such mail volume on a web interface is pretty hard!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
