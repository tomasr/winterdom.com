<font size="2">I started writing this entry while listening to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.computerzen.com">Scott<br />
Hanselman</a> go on about his sister and parallel parking (The Neo of parallel parking?)....<br />
and here I was thinking I was to hear about WSDL! (Nahh, I'm joking... it's a story<br />
funny as hell!)</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">Minutes later: There are a few terms I've seen in Scott' slides that<br />
I might disagree with (basic simplifactions that can take you easily into dangerous<br />
grounds <g>), but other than that, it has been a most entertaining presentation<br />
so far; Scott is a great presenter, and showed quite a big number of different useful<br />
tools that people can use (most of which I've used, and some new ones, such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindreef.com">MindReef</a>'s<br />
SOAPScope beta 2.</font><br />
