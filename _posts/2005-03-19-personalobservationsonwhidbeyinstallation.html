<p><!--start_raw-->I'm very excited about all that's coming with VS 2005. I also really like the IDE improvements, and all the new tools and features.</p>
<p>However, I'm not so in love with the product's installation. Don't get me wrong, installation works fairly well. However, one small part of the installation really annoys me, especially since I've installed my fair share of builds of whidbey throughout the past few months: The .NET Framework 2.0 Redistributable.</p></p>
<p>Why? the answer is two-fold:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>What the heck does the installation do that takes up to 20 minutes on my machine? It literally sucks the entire processor for 5 or 10 minutes during execution of mscorsvw.exe. In fact, on my machine at least, installing the .NET framework redistributable takes almost half the time it takes to install the rest of the product; it's ridiculous.</li>
<li>Why do I have to reboot my machine after installing the .NET framework redistributable (even of a Clean machine like the one I just installed to)? This makes little sense, particularly since we are supposed to be on the trend of avoiding reboots after product installations as much as possible (particularly on server machines).</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So, obligatory question: I'm I the only one seeing these things?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
