    That is basically the same that I did. My implementation is available at http:&#47;&#47;nhibernate.fluffnstuff.org&#47;.

<p><!--start_raw-->I've been doing some work with NHibernate lately, and I'm pretty happy with it; it works very well over all and I haven't had any significant problems. One thing that did make it a lot easier to deal with was using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ayende.com&#47;blog">Ayende</a>'s <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ayende.com&#47;projects&#47;nhibernate-query-analyzer&#47;generics.aspx">NHibernate.Generics</a> library to deal with relations in our object model, definitely recommended if you're using NHibernate directly. <br><br>In our case, we extended Ayende's work with a tiny modification and extended his EntityList<> collection to support a very simple <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.componentmodel.ibindinglist.aspx">IBindingList</a> implementation, which really helps a lot to support the Windows Forms databinding model.<br>
