<p>I <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;11&#47;01&#47;HackingMyWayIntoAnArbitraryEndpointInAWCFService.aspx">mentioned</a> a few days ago I had succeeded finally in hooking an arbitrary endpoint&nbsp;into a WCF service host in order to publish custom metadata information associated with a service. Since then, I've been working on cleaning up the code and ensuring the code actually works correctly. A few extra things I've discovered in the process:</p>
<p>I had mentioned I was setting two private properties in the HttpTransportBindingElement class: Method and InheritBaseAddressSettings. I'm not doing that anymore, as it doesn't seem to be really required. Both of my current test services work without it, and I'm still a little unclear as to what these two properties actually accomplish.</p>
<p>I also discovered that the original code I had worked well if the service was self hosted, but didn't work when hosting it in IIS. After spending a few days looking at this I found out that the problem was I wasn't adding a properly configured <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.servicemodel.activation.virtualpathextension.aspx">VirtualPathExtension</a> instance when building my IChannelListener implementation. Fortunately, it was easy to fix by simply copying the existing one in the Extensions collection of the ServiceHost, if one was present. </p>
<p>I'm now able to publish my metadata through an HTTP GET operation on services using my custom behavior by simply setting&nbsp;the EnableHttpGet property on the corresponding attribute or through the configuration file. It's pretty cool, though it requires far more code than I wished for.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;best part about all of this is that it's given me a chance to learn a lot about how certain parts of WCF work, particularly regarding how services are hosted and how metadata generated and published for a service.</p>
