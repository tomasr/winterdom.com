    <p>It worked for me.  I did get some error messages when installing SQL2K.  I clicked through them, applied SP3 and all was good.</p>

    <p>I got the same message but just hit continue and it installed fine. Got the same message when I installed the SP's and did the same thing.</p>

    <p>How did you manage to continue, I hit the continue button and nothing happens, this is win2003 datacenter with sql 2000 EE.  </p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I know it's possible to run SQL Server 2000 with Windows Server 2003, but you <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0117167&#47;2003&#47;03&#47;31.html#a213">need a service pack</a>.</p>
<p>That's fine. But how the heck are you supposed to do it if SQL2K won't install so you can apply SP3 to it? I tried for a couple of hours yesterday and failed miserably.</p></p>
<p>Do I need a slipstream SQL2K-with-sp3-already-included installation, or what?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
