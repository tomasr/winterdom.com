<p><!--start_raw-->Went through the local Tower Records store this afternoon, and after much ruffling around, found something I liked in the electronic music section. Paul Oakenfold's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;tg&#47;detail&#47;-&#47;B000067G5Y">bunkka</a>.</p>
<p>I'm very picky about electronic music, and overall, I didn't like Oakenfold's work much, but I really enjoyed some of the tracks on this one.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
