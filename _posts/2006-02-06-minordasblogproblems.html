<p><!--start_raw-->After the dasBlog migration this weekend, I discover a one issue that is causing some of the posts I imported to dasBlog not to be displayed. Sort of.<br><br><span class="postbody">Most individual posts will show up correctly, and all will be displayed correctly on the per-date pages. Except, for a few entries that will show up on the per-date page but<br />
not will fail to render if you follow the entry's permalink (either the name-based one, or the guid based on). What's more annoying: you don't<br />
get a 404 error back, just an empty page, as&nbsp; dasBlog seems to just choke on the request.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
So, here's an example: go to <a href="default,date,2006-01-09.aspx." target="_blank">&#47;weblog&#47;default,date,2006-01-09.aspx.</a> Try to follow the link for the first post in the page, and you'll get a blank page (no html generated at all).<br />
<br><br>When that happens, dasBlog will leave in it's log an entry similar to the following:<br><br></span><span><font color="#ff0000" face="Courier New">Error:<br>Entry was not found: 572<br />
at newtelligence.DasBlog.Web.Services.AggregatorBugHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext)<br />
at System.Web.CallHandlerExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication+IExecutionStep.Execute()<br />
at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep, Boolean&amp;)<br />
at System.Web.HttpApplication.ResumeSteps(Exception)<br />
at System.Web.HttpApplication.System.Web.IHttpAsyncHandler.BeginProcessRequest(HttpContext, AsyncCallback, Object)<br />
at System.Web.HttpRuntime.ProcessRequestInternal(HttpWorkerRequest)<br />
at System.Web.HttpRuntime.ProcessRequest(HttpWorkerRequest)<br />
at System.Web.Hosting.ISAPIRuntime.ProcessRequest(IntPtr, Int32)<br />
<br> while processing .</font><br><br></span><span class="postbody"><br />
<br>AFAICT, the problem seems to be with the post-date handling. I have<br />
my dasBlog installation configured to use my timezone (UTC-05:00), and<br />
all the imported entries have all dates and times specified in the same<br />
timezone in the .dayentry.xml files. It seems, that when the time the<br />
entry has reported is too close (how close I haven't verified yet) to<br />
the end of the specified day, dasBlog will just fail to display the<br />
entry completely. At least that's my appreciation of the problem.<br />
<br><br />
<br>Also, a really newbie question. What timezone should dasBlog be<br />
saving the dates for entries created in dasBlog directly? At least for<br />
my site, it seems to be saving the time in UTC-08:00, which seemed<br />
rather weird to me.<br />
<br><br />
</span><br>Any ideas?<br><br><b>Update:</b> I <i>think</i> I've managed to fix this. The problem, in essence, is that while the date &amp; times stored in dasBlog's content XML files are in "Local Time" (whatever the local time is for the server itself, hence the -8:00 I was seeing), the actual date in the XML filename should be in UTC. This is not very intuitive, as it means that if you open a file named, say, 2006-01-10.dayentry.xml, you might find that the dates on the entries contained therein actually reference an earlier or later day.<br><br>If anyone spots any entry giving trouble, please let me know and I'll see if I hosed anything else up :)<br>
