<p><!--start_raw-->Around noon today, I finally bit the bullet, called MSDN customer support, and ordered my copy of the PDC DVDs (which include the longhorn bits). Hope I get them in a few weeks time so I can browse around a bit. (Don't hope to run longhorn much around here, since my laptop only has 512MB and I wouldn't be able to give VPC more than 256MB or so :S)...<!--end_raw--></p>
