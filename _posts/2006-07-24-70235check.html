    Congrats on the exam,
    I plan to take the 70-235 exam soon as well. Any advice&#47;materials that you may have for me will be much appreciated.
    Thanks

    Shailen,
    The BizTalk 2006 documentation (make sure you pick up the latest drop) is the best resource, particularly the architecture section.

<p>Like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.sqlxml.org&#47;bryantlikes&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;07&#47;24&#47;6763.aspx">Bryant Likes</a>, I found out this weekend it seems I passed exam <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;learning&#47;exams&#47;70-235.asp">70-235</a> for BizTalk Server 2006 which I took while it was in beta. It's a big leap from a couple of years ago that I passed the BizTalk 2000 exam (I never bothered with the BizTalk 2004 one). </p></p>

<p>I don't have as many certifications as Bryant though (I'm not much of a certification junkie ;-)), but&nbsp;I might go for the Distributed Applications Developer one since I only need one exam and I already got an unused voucher around that I can use...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
