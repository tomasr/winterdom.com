<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.from9till2.com&#47;">David Ing</a> posted a great post (or essay, I would say) on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.from9till2.com&#47;PermaLink.aspx?guid=0f47a7aa-66d8-4229-989f-afbe3ae7d8bf">being a software architect</a>. I liked it. It is sensible, and, for what it's worth, seems to match my experience learning the ropes of architecture this past couple of years, and certainly makes me more aware of my current humm... what shall we call them... limitations :)<br />
