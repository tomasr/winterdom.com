<p><!--start_raw-->Simon Fell just <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pocketsoap.com&#47;weblog&#47;2002&#47;12&#47;28.html#a902">released</a> version 0.7.2 of his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pocketsoap.com&#47;tcptrace&#47;">TcpTrace</a> tool. This is one of my favourite all around tools, not just for WebService debugging, but for all kind of network and browser related issues, as well :)</p>
<p>I have one small suggestion, which I hope you don't mind, Simon: It would be very useful if the TcpTrace title bar displayed the current trace settings, similar to how IE displays the currently opened document on its own title bar. This would save me the trouble of having to use the &#47;title command line switch :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
