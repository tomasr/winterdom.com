<p>Some people, particularly former VB developers, cannot live without Edit &amp; Continue support in the Visual Studio debugger. While I agree that the feature can be useful at times, it can be easy to abuse, but that's not my main problem with it.</p></p>
<p>What I can't stand about Edit &amp; Continue is how buggy it makes the Visual Studio debugger. Just having it enabled (even if you don't use it) can make the debugger behave erratically at times. Here's just one example:</p></p>
<p><img src='http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;binary&#47;vs2008ec.png'&#47;></p></p>
<p>The problem is, I have <em>not</em> modified any source files at all, and they most certainly don't contain any errors in them either. Meanwhile, the Visual Studio output window complains about "Error processing changes in source file....", which has not been changed in weeks.</p></p>
<p>I should just remember to disable E&amp;C completely so that it stops wasting my time.</p></p>
