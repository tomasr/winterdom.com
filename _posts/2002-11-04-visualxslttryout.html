    <p>Aaron Skonnard wrote an amazing (and free) XPath evaluator that runs in IE using jscript and DHTML.  It's over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.develop.com&#47;devresources&#47;resourcedetail.aspx?type=t&id=873" rel="nofollow">http:&#47;&#47;www.develop.com&#47;devresources&#47;resourcedetail.aspx?type=t&id=873</a></p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I've been hearing about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.activestate.com&#47;Products&#47;Visual_XSLT&#47;">ActiveState's Visual XSLT</a> tool quite a bit, and I was quite intrigued by it, but never found the time to give it a through test. This weekend finally the opportunity presented itself, so I downloaded the trial version and gave it a go.</p>
<p>Well, I must admit I'm quite impressed by it. My favourite features were:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Intellisense for XSLT files: It rocks; makes dealing with the XSLT syntax a snap.</li>
<li>Debugging: The debugger is very nice, although it worked a little quirky for me. Basically, I had to press F10 twice each time to step-by-step through the transformation.</li>
<li>The XPath Workshop window: most definitely my favourite feature of all; just point to an XML file, type in the XPath expression, and the results are displayed on the window. &Uuml;ber cool!</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Although I did run into a few gotchas, I did get a feel for the power of the tool (it even works with includes and all). Most definitely, this is a tool I'd love to have on my arsenal, so I guess it's savings time so that I can afford it in a few months... not very soon, though :(</p><!--end_raw--></p>
