<p><!--start_raw-->I know I'm going to be asking a question I'm not gonna get answered, but here it goes anyway:</p>
<p>Any idea when we might see the at least a more recent preview of WSE 2.0? I'd be happy with a preview (even a buggy one)..</p></p>
<p>The reason I ask is that I've been lately playing with WSE a little bit and seeing how we could take advantage of it in our system, and of the things I've been experimenting with has been writing custom SoapTransports.</p></p>
<p>So, now, I see the entire Transport&#47;Channel stack seems to have <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dynamic-cast.com&#47;mt-archives&#47;000030.html">changed</a>, so I'd love to be able to get some bits to play with and see if I can rewrite my code to fit the new model....</p><!--end_raw--></p>
