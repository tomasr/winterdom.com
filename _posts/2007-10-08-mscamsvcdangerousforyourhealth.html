<p>I've <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;07&#47;22&#47;VistaStrikeTwo.aspx">mentioned</a> in the past that I've had some nasty performance problems with Windows Vista, particularly with the machine hanging at times paging so extreme that it completely freezes. Several weeks ago I completely disabled the pagefile and a few other things, and that helped for a while. It didn't remove the problem completely, but now it happened far more infrequently and freezed the machine for shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>This week, however, it happened several times, and I started looking a bit more closely as to what the issue is. I noticed this time it was a bit more reproducible and usually happened when I opened up "Windows Fax And Scan", an application that really shouldn't cause much trouble and that I had noticed before sometimes triggered the issue.</p>
<p>After digging a bit deeper, I think I found the culprit! I have a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;hardware&#47;digitalcommunication&#47;productdetails.aspx?pid=002">Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000</a>. It's a simple webcam that does the trick for what little I use it, and my needs are pretty modest to begin with. I always thought the software was a little clunky, but since I rarely used it much, I didn't mind.</p>
<p>However, today, after the machine froze for about 10 minutes paging (remember, with no pagefile!)&nbsp; I noticed that a process, started by MSCAMS32.EXE, which corresponds to the MSCamSvc service. It usually doesn't seem to use much memory, but seems to page a <em>lot</em>. How much? This time it was to the tune of 64'000.000+ pagefaults. Yes, <em>64 million pagefaults</em> (and I hadn't even <em>used</em> the cam recently). The closest process in paging was dwm.exe with around 19 million.</p>
<p>And that's when I realized what the deal with Windows Fax and Scan was: The MS software&#47;driver makes the webcam available to WIA (Windows Image Acquisition), which might be what WFaS uses to interact with scanner!</p>
<p>For now I've simply disabled the offending service, and we'll see how it goes. Nasty stuff...</p>
