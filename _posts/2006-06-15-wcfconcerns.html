<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;wallym&#47;">Wallace B. McClure</a> posted <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;wallym&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;06&#47;14&#47;Windows-Communication-Foundation-_2800_WCF_2900_-_2D00_-I-am-not-convinced-yet.aspx">here</a> about some of the concerns he has regarding WCF. I'm not sure I agree 100%, but he does make a pretty good point about the fact that MS is pushing WCF pretty hard as a solution to all problems, and we'll just have to see how that turns out in practice.
