<p><!--start_raw-->I've been doing a bit of reading over the past couple of months, mostly literature (as opposed to technical books). Since my birthday, I've read Lord of the Rings III, Jan Guillou's Cruzades Trilogy part I, Colleen McCullough's Song of Troy, Stephen R. Lawhead's Merlin, and I'm currently going through Gore Vidal's The Golden Age.</p>
<p>I also started reading yesterday Steve McConnell's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;tg&#47;detail&#47;-&#47;0321193679">Professional Software Development</a> book, courtesy of a good <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dotnetweblogs.com&#47;cmedina&#47;">friend</a>. It's quite entertaining, and I've found myself agreeing with quite a bit of what Steve points out in the early chapters.</p></p>
<p>I also got my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;tg&#47;detail&#47;-&#47;0321154916">"The C# Programming Language"</a> today, so it's another one to read soon.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
