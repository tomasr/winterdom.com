    <p>If you like that genre, check out Thievery Corporation, Morcheeba, Massive Attack and Portishead. </p>
    <p>Thievery is probably my favorite. Their latest disc, Richest Man in Babylon, is amazing. If you ever have the chance to see them live, highly recommend it, it's a great show.</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I've been generally regarded all around as a Metal Head, since I used to listen hard rock and heavy-metal (and from there upwards) almost exclusively. However, in the past few years, my music  taste has broaden quite a bit, and now I tend to listen to a mix of genres, still featuring rock &amp; metal promintently, too.</p>
<p>One of the music styles I've been acquiring a taste for is lounge-like music (chill out, ambience, etc.). In that vein, I picked up a copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.watermusicrecords.com&#47;">Watermusic</a>'s <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.watermusicrecords.com&#47;Merchant2&#47;merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=WMR&amp;Product_Code=302+060+263+2&amp;Category_Code="><i>Excursions; a journey into chill out</i></a> compilation CD a couple of days ago. I was quite impressed with it, and highly recommend it if you like the genre. My favorite piece so far is <i>Lost Soul</i>, by Bliss.</p></p>
<p>Last week I also picked up a copy of Garry Judd's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;watermusicrecords.com&#47;Merchant2&#47;merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=WMR&amp;Product_Code=302+060+141+2&amp;Category_Code="><i>Ambience</i></a> album, which I really like, too. The best songs in the CD are definitely <i>Coasting</i> and <i>Sheltering Sky</i>.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
