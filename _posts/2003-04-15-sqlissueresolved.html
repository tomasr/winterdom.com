<p><!--start_raw-->I just managed to resolve the <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000261.html">issue I was having</a> with SQL Server 2000 on Windows Server 2003. Thanks go to Steve Kass (a fellow MVP), who refered me to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;default.aspx?kbid=309398">KB Article 309398</a>.</p>
<p>The problem was that I had installed on my machine Certificate Server before installing SQL. Once I uninstalled it, I was able to install SQL without a hitch, after which I just reinstalled CertSrvr.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
