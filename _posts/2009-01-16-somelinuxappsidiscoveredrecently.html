    The terminal colors themselves are just tango. The Vim colorscheme is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2009&#47;01&#47;04&#47;MolokaiOn256ColorTerminals.aspx" rel="nofollow">molokai</a>

    Spare machine + gnu screen + rtorrent = rocks!
    My two cents ;)

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;ve been slowly getting back into the Linux world. I&rsquo;ve always liked a lot of things about Unix in general, and though I spent most of my work-day doing Windows development, I still like to fool around with Linux a bit in my free time.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot more time on Linux as it&rsquo;s been very helpful for my work: I put all kinds of test servers and tools there that I use during my java&#47;.NET work. Because of this, I&rsquo;ve been looking to improve my list of useful Linux applications, and I&rsquo;ve found a few that I&rsquo;ve liked well enough. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listing them here so that I don&rsquo;t forget about them later on :-):</p><br />
<h2>GNU Screen</h2>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gnu.org&#47;software&#47;screen&#47;">Screen</a> is a &ldquo;terminal multiplexor&rdquo; that allows you to have multiple windows inside an ANSI terminal or do split-screens and run separate programs on it. </p>
<p>I knew about it but always dismissed as I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what benefit it would provide for my work. I run X most of the time and like gnome-terminal or konsole well enough and for many tasks, the tab support in those is more than enough.</p>
<p>After seeing a bunch of screen-related links in reddit, however, I decided there might be something there worth looking into after all, and decided to give it a try. I&rsquo;m just starting to get the hang of it and it&rsquo;s certainly providing a bit useful, though is it an absolute must to run all the time? Not sure yet. I did found a very <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogamundo.net&#47;code&#47;screen&#47;">colorful tutorial</a> on screen :-).</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeLinuxAppsIDiscoveredRecently_12779&#47;screen_2.png"><img title="screen" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="390" alt="screen" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeLinuxAppsIDiscoveredRecently_12779&#47;screen_thumb.png" width="640" border="0"></a></p>
<p>There are a couple of features I&rsquo;ve been finding interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Detach&#47;Reattach and session sharing:</em> Allows you to detach from a session and reattach later (even connecting through SSH), or have multiple connections (even from different users) attached to the same screen sessions and viewing the same content&#47;applications. Being able to just reattach to a session gone when I accidentally closed the gnome-terminal window also seems pretty useful!</li>
<li>Vertical Splits: Modern Screen version can split your terminal window into two vertical panes, which is incredibly useful on large screens and something you can&rsquo;t replicate using the regular tabbed interfaces in other terminals (you could use multiple terminal windows, but it&rsquo;s a lot uglier to configure).</li></ul><br />
<h2>Vifm</h2>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;vifm.sourceforge.net&#47;">Vifm</a> is a console-based, but graphical file manager that uses Vi-like key bindings. The first time I ran it I immediately knew how to use it; it&rsquo;s very intuitive for Vim users.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeLinuxAppsIDiscoveredRecently_12779&#47;vifm_2.png"><img title="vifm" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="237" alt="vifm" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;SomeLinuxAppsIDiscoveredRecently_12779&#47;vifm_thumb.png" width="340" align="left" border="0"></a>I mostly stay in the shell on Linux for file operations, particularly since most graphical file managers on Linux suck imho, but for some tasks, they are easier to use. Now I have one I won&rsquo;t mind using so much, which is pretty nice.</p>
<p> Before anyone else brings it up, yes, I&rsquo;m aware of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Midnight_Commander">Midnight Commander</a>. First time I ran into it I thought it would be awesome to get that good old&rsquo; Norton Commander feeling (I loved NC!). But when I ran it, I realized I had completely forgotten how to NC was used and found Midnight Commander totally unintuitive. Go figure.</p><br />
<h2>Irssi</h2>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;irssi.org&#47;">Irssi</a> is another terminal-based IRC client (though there&rsquo;s a GUI based one too, I believe). I hadn&rsquo;t used IRC in ages, and only started hanging in it occasionally around last year or so. Despite the horrible documentation, I found Irssi to be fairly intuitive and was able to connect to a server and join a room without even going though the docs, so it&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>Some people love to script and do all kinds of things with their IRC client, but, to be honest, I don&rsquo;t care about it at all. All I want is a simple client where I could write text and get it sent and read the text others write comfortably, and Irssi seems to do the trick for now.</p>
<p>Only thing that I found tricky at first until I finally found a page commenting how it&rsquo;s done was switching between windows and scrolling. So that I don&rsquo;t forget about it</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Window #: Alt + #</li>
<li>Scroll through Windows: Ctrl + P &#47; Ctrl + N</li>
<li>Scroll window text up&#47;down : Alt + P &#47; Alt + N</li></ul>
<p>Before Irssi, I used to use X-chat and Besirc on Windows, but found myself constantly annoyed with both of them, but can&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly why.</p>
<p>So far, I only lurk around #powershell on irc.freenode.org a bit, but if anyone has any other suggestions for other groups that might suit my interests, please do let me know!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
