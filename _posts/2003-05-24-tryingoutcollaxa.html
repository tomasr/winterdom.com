    <p>I'm prototyping with the BizTalk '04 tech preview at the moment. Can't say much because of all the NDAs but I will say that I'm very impressed. In the integration with VS.NET is excellent and the Orchestration designer (same idea as what's in your screenshot) is way cool. I built a file transsfer app in about 20min without writing a single line of code.</p>

    <p>I'd love to get my hands on the new Biztalk stuff (well, or at least beta 1 when it comes out). But ooh, well... guess I'll just have to wait like everyone else until August when it's supposed to ship with MSDN :)</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I decided to download <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.collaxa.com&#47;home.index.jsp">Collaxa's</a> BPEL Server beta 9 trial today and see what it was about. As many others, I'm certainly interested enough in BEPL4WS (and anxious to see what ends up in the next release of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;biztalk&#47;">Biztalk Server</a>.</p>

<p>I've only been playing for a couple of hours with Collaxa's offering yet, but I'm already pretty impressed by what I've seen. The BPEL Console (showed in the image) is pretty nifty, and the debugging, tracing and auditing facilities seem like killer features. I'm looking forward to exploring what it offers in the next few days...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
