<p><!--start_raw-->Last week, I was visiting one of our customers, and so we started to discuss some ideas they were floating around for a possible serviced-based implementation of a new functionality into their applications. Then, it hit me: All he was talking about would've been almost trivially solvable by using logical addresses and WS-Addressing-based routing. It was quite an epiphany for me :)<!--end_raw--></p>
