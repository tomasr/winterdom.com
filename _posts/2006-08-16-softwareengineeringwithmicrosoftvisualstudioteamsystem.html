<p><a href="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;SoftwareEngineeringwithMicrosoftVisualSt_756F&#47;SamGuck_SEWMVSTS6.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;SoftwareEngineeringwithMicrosoftVisualSt_756F&#47;SamGuck_SEWMVSTS_thumb4.jpg" align="right" border="0"></a> A couple of weeks ago I received my reviewers copy of Sam Guckenheimer's <em><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;0321278720&#47;">Software Engineering with Microsoft Visual Studio Team System</a></em>. Since I had only reviewed a part of the book, I've been reading the rest of it to see the full picture, and I thought I'd share my opinion on it.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a pretty good introduction to the facilities in VSTS. The book is very oriented towards the VSTS features that support the software process (i.e. Team Foundation Server), though a few other client-side specific features of VSTS are covered as well. Since a lot of the book is about the development process (including a brief description of MSF within the context of VSTS), the reading can get a little rough at times. However, one thing I really, really liked about this book is the fact that it is full of illustrations and screenshots that make the text much more easier to follow and illustrate a lot of the concepts involved.</p>
<p>For example, Chapter 4 ("Project Management") has tons of figures illustrating the various reports that VSTS can produce, while the text explains the meaning of each report and how to interpret it in a given set of circumstances.This is pretty cool because TFS has a lot of different reports (or rather, the out of the box process templates do)&nbsp;and&nbsp;this chapter will really help you make the most of them.</p>
<p>That said, the book is hardly a comprehensive and in-depth look at VSTS. I&nbsp;think the&nbsp;project management and server features are more the focus of the book (and were you'll get the most out of it), while the rest of the stuff (like the chapters on the testing features) will mostly just give you a brief overview of what's included with the product so you can explore it then on your own.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
