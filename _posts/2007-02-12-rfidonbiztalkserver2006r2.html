    I have spent ages trawling for RFID information through MSDN and the Partners site, but haven't found too much!
    There is mention of Biztalk RFID in various 2006 articles, and also a RFID Infrastructure - the latter sounds particularly interesting to me - from event logging, to RFID device management.
    If anybody finds any more recent info (and downloads), I would be most grateful.
    Thanks!

    I think your best bet is to download and try beta 2 for yourself, which was just released and is available to the public. See http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;biztalk_server_team_blog&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;04&#47;03&#47;public-beta-for-biztalk-2006-r2-has-released.aspx

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>While looking around the MSDN site today, I ran into an interesting article: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;aa479354.aspx">"BizTalk RFID: Making RFID Deployments Easy, Simple and Economical"</a> by Karen D. Schwartz in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;architecture&#47;aa699367.aspx">MSDN Manufacturing Industry Architecture</a> center. It introduces the RFID capabilities coming up as one of the most important new features in BizTalk Server 2006 R2.</p>
<p>The article is somewhat light in details, but does introduce the basic architecture of the BizTalk RFID facilities, which I found quite interesting, since I don't really know anything about RFID :-). It does seem to me, however, that the fact that the RFID support gets built right into the integration platform will be a big plus for enterprises adopting the technology.</p>
