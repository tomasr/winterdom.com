<p><!--start_raw-->There's been quite a bit of talk about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iunknown.com&#47;Weblog&#47;Whenlessismore.html">Code Generators</a> lately. Now, personally, I think <i>some</i> kinds of code generation are great, if somewhat misused sometimes. However, I got a chuckle this weekend out of Paul DiLascia's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;msdnmag&#47;issues&#47;02&#47;11&#47;NETGUIBliss&#47;default.aspx">".NET GUI Bliss"</a> article on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</a>, where he says <i>"An important corollary is that code generators are bad"</i>.</p>
<p>What I find even funnier is that I agree with both Paul and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iunknown.com&#47;">John</a> on the topic.... there are places where code generation is the right approach, and places where just avoiding code altogether is even better. Paul's example of UI design is probably a great example of this (the code-only model of the Winforms Designer actually has serious disadvatanges... but that's a story for another time).</p></p>
<p><b>P.S.:</b> I fully agree with John's observations on OOP and reuse.</p><br />
