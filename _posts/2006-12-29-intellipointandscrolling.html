    Glad I am not the only one having the problems.  Also if I don't take the USB receiver out from my laptop - the screen saver never kicks in!

<p>I <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;12&#47;10&#47;NewMSHardwareDrivers.aspx">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago that Microsoft had released the latest Intellipoint software for the MS mice that finally supported Vista, and mentioned a few issues with the magnifier support in it. Well, there's another, more annoying problem: Scrolling with the mouse wheel doesn't work correctly.</p>
<p>To be honexst it does work most of the time. However, sometimes you'll notice that the wheel stops responding properly: you need to move the wheel a lot and fast to get just a little bit of scrolling to happen [1]. I think I finally figured what's going on: It only happens if you dicconnect and reconnect your mouse while the machine is up and running (or if you&nbsp;boot your machine&nbsp;without a mouse and then connect it). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is one of the most common things to do if you're on a laptop, making the Intellipoint software rather annoying to use for me. I'm not betting my money on a service realease soon, either. </p>
<p>There seems to be an easy&nbsp;workaround (if even more annoying than the problem): Kill the ipoint.exe process using task manager and launch it again from "c:\Program Files\Microsoft IntelliPoint\ipoint.exe". At least this [temporarily] fixes the scrolling issue for me.</p>
<p>[1] Also, vertical scrolling doesn't work for all practical purposes in a VPC2007 Virtual Machine, but I'm not sure yet whether it is a problem with the Virtual PC 2007 beta or Intellipoint.</p>
