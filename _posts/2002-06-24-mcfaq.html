    <p>Do it.  This needs to be done soooo bad.  People I talk with who are on their initial ascent up the .NET mountain are inundated with managed issues so it takes a while for them to return to C++.  When they do there is some real head scratching going on reconciling the new managed universe they just met with their old, unmanged world view.  And then it hits them...what IS MC++!?</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Has anyone seen a Managed C++ FAQ anywhere on the net? I haven't noticed any and was kind of curious about it. I'd love it if someone were to point me to one, if it exists.</p>
<p>If not, I've been thinking about getting one up and running... I think there are quite a few interesting and not-so-well known MC++ issues (and ahh... bugs) worth covering in a FAQ, but I'd like to know if anyone would find it a useful resource (or if anyone else would like to contribute).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
