<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;adrianba.net&#47;">Adrian Bateman</a> was kind enough to mail me about my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000480.html">Whidbey Installation piece</a> suggesting that perhaps the time required by the .NET Framework installation was because of the ngen'ing (man, that sounds ugly) of the framework assemblies.</p>
<p>I have since verified that he is correct, by just installing the framework standalone which does show you what it is doing. I'm hoping this time will be reduced by RTM once more optimizations and less debug code is in the product, because otherwise, it seems the NGEN performance does not look very bright...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
