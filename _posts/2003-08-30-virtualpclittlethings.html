<p><!--start_raw-->I've been fooling around with Virtual PC these few days for fun, and have run into a couple of snatches perhaps others might run into:</p>
<ol>
<li>VPC 5.2 takes a little bit of work to install on Windows Server 2003. While the installation seems successful at first, starting VPC up fails. It turns out apparently, that the installer fails to register the VPC drivers. However, installing the manually works just fine.</li>
<li>For one reason or another, VPC and Outlook 2003 (the beta refresh in this case) doesn't seem to like each other too much. So, in my case, if I try to start a VPC virtual machine while Outlook is running, it will hang until I close outlook. Don't ask me why, as I have no clue, but it <i>seems</i> it might be somehow related to the use of the network card.</li><br />
</ol><!--end_raw--></p>
