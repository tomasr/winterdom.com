  content: It doesn't help that "Save and remove" seems to overwrite your previous
    set of saved keybindings.

  content: Exactly my experience. I have come to accept the nag-dialog simply cancelling
    it for fear of breaking my binding setup - I'm content with the way it works.
    But the dialog looks so daunting I simply cannot bring myself to try out how it
    works one more time. Just Don't Move My Cheese :)

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.viemu.com&#47;">ViEmu</a> is a Vi&#47;Vim emulator add-in for Visual Studio that is the only one I consider a must-have in my Visual Studio arsenal: I love it. I&rsquo;ve mentioned ViEmu on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;18&#47;ViEmu.aspx">this blog</a> in the past, and I still consider ViEmu a wonderful addition to make Visual Studio usable for us Vim users.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that ViEmu is perfect. I&rsquo;m very happy with ViEmu most of the time, but there are a few issues that could be improved. One of those, is the Keyboard Management Dialog.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this dialog is to handle conflicts between keyboard mappings in your selected Visual Studio keyboard layout and Vim shortcuts&#47;commands that ViEmu supports. You can get to it during the first few uses, or by going to Tools &ndash;> Options &ndash;> ViEmu &ndash;> General and clicking on the Keyboard button on the right.</p>
<p>In general terms, ViEmu does a good job of finding the conflicts and telling you about them. My problem, however, is with the dialog itself, which looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;ViEmusKeybindingsDialog_13131&#47;viemu-keys_4.png"><img title="viemu-keys" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="292" alt="viemu-keys" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;ViEmusKeybindingsDialog_13131&#47;viemu-keys_thumb_1.png" width="340" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be brutally honest here: I have no freaking clue how this dialog is supposed to work. I somehow manage to set up my settings to something workable each time I re-install ViEmu, but to this day, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how I accomplish that.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with this dialog:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s not clear (to me, at least) what the buttons do. If I click on the Remove button on the right, does it remove the keybinding clashes? or does it leave the ViEmu one? What does the Forget button do? (Seriously, I have no idea).</li>
<li>The clashing bindings appear to be only manageable as a single batch. Sometimes, I&rsquo;d like an easier way to manage individual clashing bindings. While I&rsquo;m fairly sure you can do that from VS&rsquo; own keyboard layout options screen, these will get lost in all the noise, so it&rsquo;s not as obvious what you&rsquo;re doing.</li></ol>
<p>All this said, I do think the &ldquo;Keys Scanned&rdquo; textbox is a nice touch; it&rsquo;s fairly obvious what it does and seems to work well.</p>
<p>Anyway, ViEmu still rocks, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to future versions of the product to see what they come up with.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
