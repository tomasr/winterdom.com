    <p>Hi Tomas - why don't you keep the old archives online so that existing links to them still work and also import them into MT so people can now link to them from the MT generated pages?</p>

    <p>I'm going to! Unfortunately, I still have to find a way to get them back online properly. The problem was that I wasn't using straight HTML, but rather ran my weblog archive through a ASP.NET template, so it's not quite so fun....<br &#47;>
    Hopefully I'll have them back up tomorrow.</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->The basic move to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.movabletype.org&#47;">Movable Type</a> is done. The old archives are still offline and can't be accessed using the existing URLs, although all content has been succesfuly imported into MT. I hope to have this resolved soon.... (or at least some sort of solution implemented)<!--end_raw--></p>
