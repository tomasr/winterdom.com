Cool!</p>
<p>I did this for fun a couple of months ago, but actually went further, and actually implemented on WSE 2.0 beta a channel implementation that drove the call through a ServicedComponent class in the server application that did the dispatching. It was a brutal hack, for sure, but it proved an interesting way to learn the mechanics of writing WSE channels (too bad they changed the model a couple of weeks after that ;))....</p><!--end_raw--></p>
