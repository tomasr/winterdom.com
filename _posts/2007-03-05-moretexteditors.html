    I'm leaning towards E for now, because it supports the existing bundles for the holy grail of editors, TextMate.  TextMate is probably the sole reason I have a bit of Mac envy, however I will be sticking with Windows for my development.
    Hopefully the developers at E will work on the interface a bit, to make it look as clean as TextMate does.

<p>Apparent, I missed quite a few interesting text editors in my previous entry. I haven't used any of these, but quite a few look interesting enough to make me want to try them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.e-texteditor.com&#47;index.html">e-Text Editor</a>: An interesting new editor (in beta) supporting TextMate bundles on Windows. The screencast looks pretty impressive.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.getsoft.com&#47;">ED</a> for Windows: Seems to be almost a complete IDE. In fact, the interface resembles the old Developer Workbench (the Visual C++ 5&#47;6 IDE). I'm guessing this one probably won't fall under the "lightweight" category...</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.context.cx&#47;">ConTEXT</a>: This seems to be an interesting offering halfway between a simple editor and full-blown IDE. Doesn't seem to be quite as extensible as other editors (which is fine by me) and I couldn't find if it supports syntax highlighting for C# (a must).</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;02&#47;06&#47;Intype.aspx">Intype</a>: I've already mentioned this one before. Not very lightweight, as it has no xcopy deployment support (a shame, really, cause it is very promising).</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.emeditor.com&#47;">EmEditor</a>: Seems to have a significant feature&nbsp;set. The website could be improved, though...</li></ul>
<p>Found this while going through a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;discuss.joelonsoftware.com&#47;default.asp?biz.5.454585.35">thread</a> on the topic in Joel On Software's forums. Lots of opinions to read :-)</p>
