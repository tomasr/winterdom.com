    Hi Tomas
    I use a JavaScript class to highlight code examples:
    http:&#47;&#47;www.dreamprojections.com&#47;syntaxhighlighter
    Is excellent because you only paste the code and don&#180;t need to worry how it look, also has other options to show the line or columns numbers, etc.
    Some examples

    http:&#47;&#47;www.filehelpers.com&#47;example_progress.html
    I was playing a bit with the CSS and I love it.
    Cheers
    Marcos

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>What are people using this day to post code (and I mean good looking code) to their blogs these days?&nbsp;I've tried a lot of options without finding a good way of doing it, though I see a lot of people getting it done without issues, so I must be doing something wrong. Hopefully one of you can enlighten me as to how :)</p>
<p>Here are some options I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy from VS, paste into Word, paste from Word into your blog entry. I've used this one successfully on the past (though it's cumbersome) as long as I did my posting from IE (never could get it to work right with Firefox and of course it just plain doesn't work with Windows Live Writer), until a couple of days ago when it just stopped working right; no clue why.</li>
<li>Use a third party formatting tool, including: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jtleigh.com&#47;people&#47;colin&#47;software&#47;CopySourceAsHtml&#47;">CopySourceAsHtml</a>&nbsp;(which I haven't been able to get fully working with VS2005, btw), all the code-formatting Windows Live Writer plugins I've found and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.manoli.net&#47;csharpformat&#47;">this</a>. All of the seem to generate HTML that looks great on the browser, but, for some reason, the code turns to sh*t&nbsp;by the time it reaches&nbsp;my RSS aggregator.</li></ul>
<p>So, any clues would sure be appreciated :-)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
