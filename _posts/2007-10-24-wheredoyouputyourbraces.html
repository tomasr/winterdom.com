    I tend to put my braces on the same line within control statements etc. but on a separate line when writing methods&#47;functions etc... except on my blog where I tend to compress those down to keep posts short...

    I used to do something similar, but the VS automatic formatting just gets too much in the way :)

    I like to put my braces on a new line, it gives the appearence of more readability to me, by putting a little bit of white space between your function declarations and the body of the function. Of course like all good rules, I have one exception:
    Simple property getters and setters I tend to do get { return _variable; }
    This probally stems from the fact that this is the default behavior of the prop snippet which I love so dearly!

    I put mine wherever ReSharper decides they should be.  I used to have an opinion but it's too easy just to let the tool do its thing.

    I prefer the brace on the same line style because I find that vertical space is always at a premium - I want to see more code and avoid scrolling if necessary. I'm happy that this was the default style on the DLR team when I joined.
    BTW, you can always re-jig your VS 2005+ editor settings so that CTRL-A CTRL-K CTRL-F formats your code in whatever style that you want.

    I like my braces on a dedicated line, it makes the code more cleaner. Sometimes when its just a single like of code, especially getter and setters, I just put them on a single line.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>If you're writing code in a programming language derived from C (i.e. one of those with pesky curly braces), where do you like putting your braces? </p>
<p>Some people like putting the opening brace on a line by itself right after the declaration&#47;statement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="133" alt="NextLineBraces" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;Wheredoyouputyourbraces_8911&#47;NextLineBraces_8.png" width="586" border="0"> </p>
<p>I'm one of those that usually does this. It just was something I got used to from my C&#47;C++ days and since it was the common convention in .NET back when I started fiddling around with it in 2000&#47;2001. So this is usually what I use when coding on C#. </p>
<p>However, other people like to put the opening brace inline with the declaration&#47;statement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="106" alt="InlineBraces" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;Wheredoyouputyourbraces_8911&#47;InlineBraces_6.png" width="585" border="0"> </p>
<p><em>This question is brought to you courtesy of me noticing that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ironruby.net">IronRuby</a> favors the "inline opening brace" style.</em></p>
<p>Actually, I use the inline-opening-brace style myself when I'm working with Java. I don't mind it, but it somehow seems wrong sometimes. I mean, using different styles when working across two languages so similar? I mean, I already have enough trouble remembering stuff like string vs. String and ToLower() vs toLowerCase() to worry about how the code looks ;-).</p>
<p><em>Historical Note:</em> A few years back I used to be weirder and used a mixed style where I used braces-on-next-line for some things and inline-opening-brace for others depending on what it was and how many lines were in between the opening and closing braces. Yes, I was (am?) anal like that. I finally gave up on it when I grew tired of fighting the auto-formatting rules in IDEs.</p>
<p>What style do you favor, and why?</p>
