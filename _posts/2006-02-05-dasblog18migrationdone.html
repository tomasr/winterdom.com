<p><!--start_raw-->I've just completed the migration of my blog from the old (really old) Movable Type version I was using to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dasblog.info&#47;">dasBlog</a> 1.8. It was actually a lot less painful than I expected, but I was able to take advantage of MT's very powerful templates to pretty much generate all the new dasBlog datafiles needed.<br><br>All content in the old blog has been imported into dasBlog and I've set up a redirection mechanism so that if you browse to an individual archive page (say &#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;0000XXX.html), a 301 permanent redirection will be returned to the entry in dasBlog. Also, the main RSS feed has also been redirected to the dasBlog-produced one, which is hopefully working fine :)<br><br>I've also created a customized dasBlog theme for my blog which is somewhat similar to the one I was using with MT, but somewhat nicer, so for those of you browsing to the actual page it should look fine (any suggestions&#47;criticisms are welcome :))<br><br>Finally, you can now access the individual category pages (which dasBlog of course generates automatically). I created and categorized my blog entries in MT months ago, but had not made them public, but now they are, so feel free to subscribe to specific topics.<br>
