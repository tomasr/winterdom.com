<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;moustafa&#47;">Moustafa Khalil Ahmed</a> (from the Windows Workflow Foundation Team) recently <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;moustafa&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;03&#47;23&#47;559391.aspx">blogged</a> about how the SqlTrackingService included in WF does data partitioning across tables to keep data partitioned to smaller subsets for completed workflows. <br><br>Moustafa was kind enough to answer some <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forums.microsoft.com&#47;MSDN&#47;ShowPost.aspx?PostID=316178&amp;SiteID=1&amp;mode=1">extra questions</a> about how it worked on the WF forums, and this was his answer, which I believe completements the stuff on his weblog:<br><br><br />
<blockquote><span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">"The<br />
partition is done on the completion of the workflow instance. That is<br />
your records will be in your regular tables until the instance<br />
completes and this is when the records are going to move to the added<br />
tables. This is designed for applications that have no downtime do not<br />
want to incur downtime. We do have an offline scheme as well, so if you<br />
have a downtime and want to do partitioning during that time or you<br />
want to avoid moving records around when the instances complete or for<br />
any other reason you can schedule a task that runs<br />
PartitionCompletedWorkflowInstances stored proc which will move all<br />
currently completed instances from the live tables to the partitions.<br />
Host applications don&rsquo;t need special privileges to create those tables,<br />
the user should be part of the tracking_ roles that are defined in the<br />
SqlTrackingService database. </font></span></i></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></span></i></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">SqlTrackingQuery<br />
will look at the partitioned tables as well. You can look at the<br />
PartitionCompletedWorkflowInstances stored proc as a starting point if<br />
you want to have your own Archiving and Purging story other than the<br />
one we provide out of box. We are working on documenting the<br />
SqlTrackingService schema in WF&rsquo;s help</font>.</font></span>"</i></p></span></blockquote><br><span></span>
