<p><!--start_raw-->Some people seem to still be subscribed to my old RSS 0.91 feed for my <a href="&#47;mcppfaq&#47;">MC++ FAQ</a>, which was discontinued a long time ago since I moved it to RSS 2.0. For some reason, I had left lying the original xml file, which should be deleted now. Please update your feeds if your among them!<!--end_raw--></p>
