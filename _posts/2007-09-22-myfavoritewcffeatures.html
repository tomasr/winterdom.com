<p>After working with Windows Communication Foundation for a while, I've reached the conclusion that the two features in WCF that I like the most are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Generic Service Contracts:</strong> That is, the combination of using simple contracts with a single, catch-all operation and untyped data contracts (a.k.a. the System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message class). Particularly for one way, scenarios, these are really powerful and flexible. In other words, stuff like this:</p>
<pre>[ServiceContract]<br />
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">interface</span> IGenericOneWayService<br />
{<br />
[OperationContract(Action=<span style="color: maroon">"*"</span>, IsOneWay=<span style="color: maroon">true</span>)]<br />
<span style="color: blue">void</span> Execute(Message msg);<br />
}<br />
</pre></p>
<p><strong>2. Custom Bindings:</strong> Creating custom bindings by composing arbitrary sets of BindingElements is extremely flexible and a provides an excellent extensibility mechanism, particularly when you introduce custom protocol channels (i.e. above the transport channel) into the mix. </p></p>
<p>It took a bit of time for these to finally "click" for me, but I know fully realize this is a pretty cool thing to have in the framework. I do wish there was better validation of custom bindings, as well as a way to specify declaratively the requirements and capabilities of binding elements.</p></p>
