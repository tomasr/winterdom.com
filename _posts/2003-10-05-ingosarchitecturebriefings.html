<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ingorammer.com">Ingo Rammer</a> has now started publishing his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ingorammer.com&#47;ArchitectureBriefings&#47;default.html">Architecture Briefings</a> whitepapers. Not only is the content great, but I really think he got quite a nice layout and presentation for them (which always helps in readability). Go get'em!<!--end_raw--></p>
