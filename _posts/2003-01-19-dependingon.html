<p><!--start_raw--><i><quote>"Today my advice is to avoid learning how it works, because it's gonna change, and you don't want to be depending on the behavior of any given collector"</quote></i> [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;staff.develop.com&#47;jasonw&#47;weblog&#47;2003&#47;01&#47;16.html#a139">Jason Whittington</a>]. Am I the only one who draws a distinction between knowing <i>how</i> something works, and writing code that <i>explicitly depends</i> on that behavior?</p>
<p>P.S: Granted, this ain't easy, but I'd feel far more comfortable about this than treating everything as a black box I know nothing about because it could change... It just makes me nervous.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
