<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>A few days ago the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.google.com&#47;group&#47;vim_dev&#47;browse_thread&#47;thread&#47;f5d2f41aeacd5f93">second beta release</a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org&#47;">Vim</a> 7.2 came out and I decided to give it a try. Seems to be working great so far, and I'm pretty excited about this release for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Performance Improvements:</em> Under Windows, Vim 7.1 had some&#160; performance problems, particularly related to redrawing the screen. This was particularly noticeable when scrolling large windows with syntax highlighted code with the mouse wheel, and when redrawing the [omni-] completion menu.       <br &#47;>The former feels much snappier, even with long lines, while the second appears to be fixed altogether!</li>
<li><em>Floating Point support:</em> I don't create much Vim scripts myself, but I'm excited by some of the possibilities this opens up for scripts I may use. One example of this is Yukihiro Nakadaira's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org&#47;scripts&#47;script.php?script_id=2283">HueRotation</a> script.</li> </ol>
