    BizTalk and HIS are quite connected. I think that's why they call HIS 2006. It was supposed to be released somewhere near BizTalk 2006 I believe too.
    Best regards

<p><!--start_raw-->I'm in Lima, Peru all this week, so probably won't be able to blog much. Meanwhile, several important releases are coming out:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.netfx3.com&#47;blogs&#47;news_and_announcements&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;11&#47;06&#47;.NET-Framework-3.0-has-been-released_2100_.aspx">.NET FX 3.0 RTM</a>: WCF, WPF, WF and Cardspace all in RTM. I'll be installing it as soon as I get back home and have a decent internet connection available.</li>
<li>Microsoft <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;hiserver&#47;default.mspx">Host Integration Server 2006</a> has been released as well. Here's the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyID=E4A40127-D73C-4D41-B8B4-FBBE68EEC47E&amp;displaylang=en">evaluation download</a>. Can someone please explain why if HIS came out after Commerce Server, why is it still a "2006" product while Commerce is a "2007" one?</li>
<li>Alongside HIS 2006, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyId=C0D4B943-1786-4B74-A9A4-FDAA582F5FA2&amp;displaylang=en">Host Adapters for BizTalk 2006</a> have been released as well.</li></ul></p>
