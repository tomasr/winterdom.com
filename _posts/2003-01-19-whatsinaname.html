    <p>While we're on the subject, you might want to correct my name in blogrol ;-)</p>
---
<p><!--start_raw-->A name. What's in a simple name? Could be tons, could be nothing. But when it is a person's name, it probably has.</p>
<p>Now, I've been called many things. I've seen my name distorted all kinds of ways. And you know what? I usually don't mind it much, particularly because I know my name and last name ain't exactly easy to pronounce.</p></p>
<p>But, oh, the power of the written word! What I do mind is seeing my name incorrectly written. I'm sure nobody does it on purpose, it's just hard sometimes. But seeing my name written incorrectly at least three times in the past couple of days is just a little too much for my taste.</p></p>
<p>So, here's the game: My last name is not Restrapo. It ain't Restapo, either. Certainly not Resteppo. It's R-E-S-T-R-E-P-O. Restrepo. Got it? Thanks!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
