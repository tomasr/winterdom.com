<p><!--start_raw-->While trying to diagnose a problem during development, our project team ran into the BizTalk 2004 bug described in knowledge base article <a href="http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;891447">891447</a>: <i>"FIX: A distinguished field returns incorrect content when you use the empty <FieldName &#47;> element tag form for the empty field in BizTalk Server 2004"</i></p>
<p>Pretty nasty bug if you're using Distinguished Fields in your orquestrations. In our case, we where using them to populate a new message that was then sent to a different application, so it kept getting the wrong content and it was not evident why!</p></p>
<p>Let's hope this makes it into SP2 (if one is planned, I don't know)...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
