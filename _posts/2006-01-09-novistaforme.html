    <p>I think you should try without your external usb drive. I had the same problem. <br &#47;>
    I have 2 external usb drive and one of them is not working well with vista. If i plug it after the installation, explorer needs about 10 mins to see the datas. It's a SanMax HD337 combo (usb2 + firewire)</p>

    I've found that using a wired network connection during installation resolved all my issues.

<p><!--start_raw-->I've been trying to install Vista build 5270 on my new laptop for the past couple of days with no luck. Installation just takes forever and never seems to end, just sitting there with 100% processor usage and minimal disk activity. I've tried disabling the wireless adapter, disconnecting all external deviced (just my usb mouse and an external usb drive) with no luck at all. FWIW, the machine is a Dell Inspiron 6000 with a 2.0 GHz centrino and 2 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Honestly, this doesn't inspire too much confidence on my part for the quality of vista. Sure, the new installer is pretty, but if it doesn't work properly it's not much use. What's more scary is that the problem of the install taking huge ammounts of time seems pretty common and well known, up to the point of the installer itself poping up messages saying <i>"Installation is taking longer than expected, but should finish soon"</i>... needless to say, it hadn't finished more than one hour later when I finally got tired of it and killed it :(</p><!--end_raw--></p>
