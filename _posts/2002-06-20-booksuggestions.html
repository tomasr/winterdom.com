    <p>Sam: Of course I've got your book! Wouldn't have missed it! As for the design patterns books, read them both... I also like Frank Buschmann's books on patterns.</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I'm looking into buying a few more books, as I received a few nice <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;">Amazon</a> gift certificates for my graduation (in case you really want to know, I'm finally getting my bachellor's degree tomorrow!).</p>
<p>So I'm really looking for some good suggestions on which books to get, and which books to wait for (provided I don't have to wait too long!). One I'm considering is Bob Beauchemin's "Essential ADO.NET". I'm also giving some serious consideration to Kim B. Bruce's "Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages" (I like programming languages theory, what can I say).</p></p>
<p>So, if you've got any good suggestions, comment on this post or <a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">send</a> them. I'm looking for any advanced .NET topics, programming language&#47;compiler related topics, or any good book on general software development. So, suggest away!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
