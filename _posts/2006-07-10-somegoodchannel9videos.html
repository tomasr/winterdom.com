<p><!--start_raw-->I love Channel9; it's a great resource. I really like the interview videos, even if I just put them on the background to listen to while I work :). Here are some good Channel9 videos I've watched lately (they're not necessarily new, I just hadn't had the time to watch them before):<br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;Showpost.aspx?postid=202138">Chatting about LINQ and Entities</a>, with Anders Hejlsberg and Sam Drucker. It's always nice to see Anders talk, he's very clear and provides pretty good insights into his designs.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;Showpost.aspx?postid=202138">InfoCard - Deep Architecture</a>. Nice introduction to what infocard does and how it does it. The question on managed versus unmanaged at the end cracked me up.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;Showpost.aspx?postid=212481">There's something about XAML</a>, with Rob Relyea. Pretty good introduction to XAML (I already knew some of this stuff, but it's always nice to see it all put in perspective).</li></ul>Queued up for viewing later this week:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;Showpost.aspx?postid=212481">Phoenix Framework</a>, with Jim Hogg. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;phoenix&#47;">Phoenix</a> is a pretty cool technology, I got to hear Jim do a brief introduction of it a few years ago and was very, very cool.</li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;ShowPost.aspx?PostID=194959">Metropolis</a>, with Brad Ulrich<br></li></ul>
<p></p><!--end_raw--></p>
