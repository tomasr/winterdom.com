<p><!--start_raw-->While searching for a few things this morning, I ran into an older <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;cweyer&#47;archive&#47;2004&#47;03&#47;11&#47;88450.aspx">post</a> from Christian, pondering whether Indigo was supposed to be the next version of COM+ or not. This, of course, has been discussed quite a bit in posts from others like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gotdotnet.com&#47;team&#47;dbox&#47;default.aspx">Don</a> [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;dbox&#47;default.aspx">2</a>] and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;richardt">Richard</a>.</p>
<p>What did intrigued me was that, shortly after that, I ran into <a href="http:&#47;&#47;archives.neohapsis.com&#47;archives&#47;microsoft&#47;various&#47;dcom&#47;2001-q4&#47;0164.html">these</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;archives.neohapsis.com&#47;archives&#47;microsoft&#47;various&#47;dcom&#47;2001-q4&#47;0072.html">old</a> posts from Steve Swartz on the DCOM mailing list, where he mentions "Diablo" as being "the code name for the managed service environment that will ship next year" (that was 2001, btw).</p></p>
<p>Does anyone care to tell the uninformed (aka "me") what diablo was supposed to have been (or is) and what relation it ended having with Indigo, if any?</p><br />
