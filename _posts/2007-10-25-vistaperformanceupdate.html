<p>A few weeks ago I commented I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;09&#47;MSCamSvcDangerousForYourHealth.aspx">had found</a> a very promising lead in trying to find out the cause of my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;07&#47;22&#47;VistaStrikeTwo.aspx">performance problems</a> in Windows Vista, in the services&#47;drivers for my simple Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 webcam.</p>
<p>I can now say that indeed disabling this service has caused a dramatic improvement in performance and responsiveness, and since disabling it I haven't experienced the "machine locking paging frenzy" I was constantly running into.</p>
<p>Now that I feel more confident about the machine not locking up (and now that I resolved my bluetooth issues as well), I've also gotten rid of the pagefile and I switched off Aero and I'm using Vista Basic. It's not as nice looking (alright, the light blue window borders&#47;backgrounds are as ugly as they come), but the machine definitely seems more responsive. It also helps that once you do this you get rid of dwm.exe's memory eating disorder&nbsp; (and yes, that's another process that <em>loves</em> to page a lot).</p>
<p>All of this definitely makes living on Vista a lot more bearable (though by no means a WOW experience or anything). Oh well, at least this way I don't have to give up Spider Solitaire yet ;-).</p>
