<p><!--start_raw-->Miscellaneous bits here and there. I started reading through Martin Fowler's new book yesterday, and imagine my surprise to find my name listed on the book's preface. Sure, I had written a couple of comments to the author back when he had his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.martinfowler.com&#47;isa&#47;">ISA</a> pages up (nothing big, really), but I never got any kind of reply, so I assumed he never got it, or didn't read it. Guess, I was wrong :)</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I remembered last week one of my favourite lines in a song. From Tears for Fears' "Everybody wants to rule the world": <br&#47;><br />

Make of that what you will....</p><!--end_raw--></p>
