<p><!--start_raw-->While browsing around today I found out that one of the best computer-related magazines I've ever read is not longer being published. The magazine was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.swexpert.com">Server&#47;Workstation Expert</a> (formerly known as SunExpert Magazine). It's a crying shame, really, cause it had, imho, wonderful writers!</p>
<p>So, if you feel like doing some reading, be sure to check the magazine's archives and read a few of Michael O'Brien's <i>Ask Mr. Protocol</i> columns, which are located on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.swexpert.com&#47;C1&#47;">C1 section</a> of the archive.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
