<p><!--start_raw-->Brian Harry has a very cool <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;bharry&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;11&#47;12&#47;492198.aspx">post</a> on how they do manage the branching structure in the developer division for VS development. It's always great to hear about this stuff and how they are using the product.</p>
