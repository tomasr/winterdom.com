<p><!--start_raw-->I haven't blogged about this, since I imagined everyone had <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;2003&#47;02&#47;05.html#a110">already seen it</a>. But today Clemens <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0108971&#47;2003&#47;02&#47;07.html#a115">announced</a> he finally cracked one of the problems he had.</p>
<p>I can only say it sounds awfully cool, and look forward to seeing it in action myself!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
