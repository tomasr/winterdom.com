<p><!--start_raw-->Just found out that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.gotdotnet.com&#47;raymondc&#47;">Raymond Chen</a> (of TweakUI fame) is blogging! Subscribed! A few years ago, Raymond used to post fairly often to some of the microsoft newsgroups, and I always found his posts very informative.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.gotdotnet.com&#47;ptorr&#47;">Peter Torr</a> (of JScript.NET fame) is also blogging now. So is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.gotdotnet.com&#47;emeijer&#47;">Erik Meijer </a>(of MS Research). Welcome, guys!</p><br />
