<p>Now that Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 is out, I&rsquo;ve spent some time updating the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;2009&#47;06&#47;classifier-sample-update">editor</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;2009&#47;06&#47;current-line-highlighting-for-vs2010">extensions</a> I created for VS2010 using the new extensibility model so that they work with Beta 2. The changes needed haven&rsquo;t been very extensive, but they were not obvious at first.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the most important changes that were required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IEnvironment interface is gone, and this affected a few signatures of methods in the extensibility interfaces.</li>
<li>The [VsCatalogName] attribute is also gone, and needed to be removed from the assembly.</li>
<li>The *.vsixmanifest file now needs to be always named source.extension.vsixmanifest, and it needs to be added to your VS project with the action set to &ldquo;None&rdquo;. Otherwise, you will get a build error.</li>
<li>The schema for the VSIX manifest file has changed, so I had to update it by hand. Most changes aren&rsquo;t too big, mostly the case of elements and attributes. I did get stuck a bit here after incorrectly changing my <Components&#47;> section, but <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;noahsmark&#47;status&#47;5022178964">@noahsmark</a> helped me get it resolved. Thanks!</li> </ol>
<p>Other than this, the process has been mostly straightforward.</p>
<p>You can get the updated code for my KeywordClassifier extension from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;KeywordClassifier">GitHub repository</a>. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of how it looks like in the new beta:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;KeywordExt.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="KeywordExt" border="0" alt="KeywordExt" src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;KeywordExt_thumb.png" width="587" height="480" &#47;></a> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also updated the code of my LineAdornments extension, and the updated code is in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;tomasr&#47;LineAdornments">GitHub repository</a> as well. Unfortunately, I seem to have hit an issue with this one that I haven&rsquo;t managed to resolve successfully yet, which I&rsquo;ll mention on another post.</p></p>
