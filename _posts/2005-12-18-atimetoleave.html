<p><!--start_raw-->I guess this is as good a time as any to make it public: I've taken the decision to leave my current job with Intergrupo S.A. at the end of this year, which means I'll only be with the company a couple more weeks.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to make, given the fact that I've been there for 5 years now, during which there was much learning and both personal and professional growth, and of course, leaving the security of a steady paying job :) I'll be sorry to leave many good friends behind, but, at the same time, I'm very excited about the upcoming changes in my life and the opportunities said change will open for me.</p></p>
<p>I'm not really ready to openly discuss what my plans at the moment are, but that will hopefully change in a few weeks. For anyone who has read this far, wish me luck!</p></p>
<p>Update: A few people have asked if perhaps I'm going to work for MS. Just wanted to say that ain't it :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
