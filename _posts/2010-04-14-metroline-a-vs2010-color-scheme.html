    custom coloring for control flow and access modifier keywords really helps visualize
    class design *while looking at the implementation class itself* (rather than opening
    up its interface, if it has one, or using a diagramming tool).  It should really
    have been included in default visual studio syntax coloring customizations, IMO.\r\n\r\nOf
    course the custom colored LINQ operators are nice too :)\r\n\r\nAlso, thank you
    so much for sharing the code! It will give me a great place to start for working
    on an add-in to separate type&#47;method definition colors from type&#47;method
    invocation colors."

  content: Hm, you seem to have changed the font size of the tooltip window. This
    is unfortunate, because it is actually more readable if it has the same size as
    the underlying text, as you can simply "continue effortlessly" with reading. By
    making the font bigger, I have to refocus my eyes somewhat. Can you change that
    back or email me with what I have to change in the vvssettings file?

<p>This is my first color scheme specifically created for Visual Studio 2010; I&rsquo;m not likely to port it back to VS2005&#47;2008 but I&rsquo;m sure it would be possible if someone cared enough about it.</p>
<p>I started this color scheme on VS2008 but never completed it. When the Visual Studio 2010 betas started coming out, I imported it there and started tweaking it though a lot of revisions here and there as I used it. It&rsquo;s been pretty much what I&rsquo;ve been using for all my VS2010 development.</p><br />
