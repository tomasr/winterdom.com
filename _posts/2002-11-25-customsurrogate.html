<p><!--start_raw-->Well, the use of <code>CoRegisterSurrogateEx()</code> turned out to be easier than I expected. I buildt a small managed sample to try it out, and the result is <a href="&#47;dev&#47;dotnet&#47;CustomSurrogate.zip">here</a>*.</p>
<p>Of course, this API seems to be pretty undocumented, but a quick Google search turned up <a href="http:&#47;&#47;archives.neohapsis.com&#47;archives&#47;microsoft&#47;various&#47;dcom&#47;2001-q4&#47;0356.html">this</a>, which was enough to get me started.</p></p>
<p><b>*:</b> Since I'm a lazy sob, the sample as is won't run on Win2k, since the server application uses the ApplicationID attribute. Getting around it is left as an exercise for the reader :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
