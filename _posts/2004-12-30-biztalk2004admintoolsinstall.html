<p><!--start_raw-->I'm testing a few BizTalk Server 2004 installation variants lately, and ran into a snag. What I was trying to do was install BizTalk Server on one machine, and then setup a second machine with only the administration tools.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;download.microsoft.com&#47;download&#47;5&#47;1&#47;2&#47;512c18fe-482c-4925-a790-3ef9110b3acc&#47;Installation%20Guide(EN).htm">Installation Guide</a>, on the section "Performing a Custom Installation", if you only install the Admininstration and Monitoring Tools, SQLXML 3.0 is not a needed prerequisite.</p></p>
<p>However, no matter what I do, the BizTalk Installer keeps asking for SQLXML to be installed on the machine where the administration tools will go. Is the documentation wrong about this point, or am I doing something incorrectly?</p><!--end_raw--></p>
