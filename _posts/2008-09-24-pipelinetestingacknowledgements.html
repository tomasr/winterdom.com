<p>This morning I announced the release of PipelineTesting v1.2.0.0. </p>
<p>Now I need to mention that for this release, I need to give a huge &iexcl;Thank You! to the people who contributed to it by reporting bugs and potential problems, providing some great feature suggestions and even some code!</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bram Veldhoen</li>
<li>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Hautecoeur</li>
<li>Mark Coleman</li>
<li>GokulRaja Dhamodaran</li>
<li>Gregory Van de Wiele, as always :-)</li></ol>
<p>Bram has also been working on some really cool stuff to integrate PipelineTesting features with BizUnit!</p>
<p>A huge thanks to each and everyone of you. And please keep the suggestions and bug reports coming :-)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
