    Thanks guys! Yes, it occurred to me later on that I could just "execute" the path and get the right behavior, but, to be honest, getting the right explorer parameters was a challenge I wanted to get done :) (I'm still not 100% sure why the above works while "&#47;e,`"$loc`"" didn't).

    Never have used that command, thanks for sharing (I always used "start .").  Strangely enough, both these commands worked without errors:
    $loc = "."
    explorer "&#47;e,"$loc""
    explorer "&#47;e,`"$loc`""

    Jason: Yes, that works for me if $loc doesn't have spaces in it. That's when it breaks for me.

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I tend to fire up Windows Explorer instances from my prompt very often, either on the current directory or in other spots. I was pretty used to using the <code>&ldquo;explorer &#47;e,
<path>&rdquo;</code> command from CMD.EXE but I never had figured out exactly how to use it on PowerShell and have it work reliably: Paths with spaces always caused it to open the default documents folder instead.</p>
<p>Finally sat down and played with it until I got it right:</p>
<div class="codebg"><code><span class="Comment"># open explorer in this directory</span><br><span class="Keyword">function</span>&nbsp;<span class="Function">exp</span>(<span class="Type">[string]</span>&nbsp;<span class="Identifier">$loc</span> = <span class="String">'.'</span>) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; explorer <span class="String">"&#47;e,"</span><span class="Identifier">$loc</span><span class="String">""</span><br>} </code></div><!--end_raw--></p>
