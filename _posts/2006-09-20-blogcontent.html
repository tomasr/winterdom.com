    Maybe, some non-tech stuff about what you do in your spare time. That'd give a balance to the blog :-)

    Scott: I'm glad you like it. I'm working on posting more stuff and keeping up with a higher posting frequency, hopefully it will be stuff you like!

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>As some of you have probably noticed by now, I've been trying to pick up my posting frequency on this blog; mostly trying to become more regular with the stuff I post and trying to share a bit more about the stuff I'm working on and the stuff I'm playing and experimenting with.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from some of you, though, on what you think of the blog. Do you like the content I'm putting up? Is it useful? Are the topics I'm focusing interesting to you? I sure appreciate any feedback on this and any comments on topics you'd like to see more&#47;less on. I certainly don't promise anything, but I do try to post stuff that will benefit someone besides myself :-)</p>
<p>Feel free to leave a comment or send me an email!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
