    This isn't guaranteed to work.  But something I usually try prior to complete re-install is a user profile refresh.  Log in as the administrator (assuming you use some other account routinely), change the name of your routine user's folder in documents and settings (I like renaming over deleting), log out and log back in with your routine user.  It will recreate your profile (filesystem + registry) and clear out many obnoxious and otherwise impossible to find erroneous&#47;inconsistent states.

<p>So much for trying to solve <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;02&#47;TheMythOfVS2005TeamSuite.aspx">this</a> by attempting to change my visual studio configuration. As soon as I tried to start the Visual Studio 2005 installation to add the missing components I was greeted by the infamous error:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>d:\vs\vs_setup.msi could not be opened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uninstalling VS2005 to reinstall wouldn't work, either; it does use the same setup after all. So now I have the pleasure of having to start setting up my development virtual machine from scratch courtesy of a screwed VS installation. <sarcasm>Thanks goodness this is <em>just</em> a virtual machine and not my main one</sarcasm>.</p>
