<p><!--start_raw-->I'm just coming back up again from upgrading my notebook (well, my only computer at home, really <g>) with Windows Server 2003. So far, I've got VS.NET 2002 &amp; 2003 (but with no docs.... msdn too big for me to download!), office 2003 beta 2 and a bunch of other tools installed. It will be a while yet before I get things going just as I want them...<!--end_raw--></p>
