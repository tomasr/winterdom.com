<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;jeremy.miller&#47;">Jeremy Miller</a> has<br />
posted an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;jeremy.miller&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;04&#47;144032.aspx">excellent<br />
article</a> with tips about working with Legacy Code. I've had similar<br />
experiences with some code that definitely meets the definition Jeremy proposes:<br />
<em>"Legacy Code is code you're afraid of"</em>. I particularly agree with the<br />
tip that improving error handling in legacy code (which is usually a mess, in my<br />
experience) is a critical step to&nbsp;prevent the code from making your life<br />
miserable.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
