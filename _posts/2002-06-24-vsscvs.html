    <p>Have you looked at Perforce (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.perforce.com&#47;)?" rel="nofollow">http:&#47;&#47;www.perforce.com&#47;)?</a><br &#47;>
    I've had only good experience with it. It's stable, fast (very!), and is used by some very large projects. Surprisingly, administration is something every reasonable developer can do.</p>
    <p>(I don't know how much it costs, though.)<br &#47;>

    <p>Thanks for the comments, Ziv... I've heard good things about Perforce before, although it is priced somewhat above what I could even consider ;)<br &#47;>

    <p>I haven't had too many problems with VSS. I would seriously look at your admin policies if it's so bad -- particularly running analyze, raid storage, etc. Because of VSS's architecture, I think people tend to assume that the server doesn't require much maintainence... Anyway, I'm looking forward to Vault, since I've heard mainly good things about sourceOffSite, and the feature list looks really interesting (SQL 2K as storage, written in C#, functionality exposed as web services).</p>

    <p>[Sorry, put the link in the wrong place] Vault is located at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;vault.sourcegear.com&#47;." rel="nofollow">http:&#47;&#47;vault.sourcegear.com&#47;.</a></p>

    <p>Hi John!<br &#47;>
    Thanks for the comments.. at least that gives me hope. </p>
    <p>To be honest, the kind of problem's I've had with sourcesafe are:<br &#47;>
    - Deleted files that SourceSafe explorer doesn't see, but keep getting retrieved on a GetLatestVersion.<br &#47;>
    - Non-deleted Files that are there on the sourcesafe db, that are correctly retrieved on get latest version, but that the Sourcesafe explorer doesn't see.<br &#47;>
    - that piece of crap otherwise known as VS.NET integration, which really, really sucks for webprojects.</p>
    <p>If you know of any good sources of information on sourcesafe administration, or you have some tips to share, I'd really, really appreciate it!</p>

    <p>Hi, I highly recommend Perforce, but if u cannot afford it, then my suggestion would be to stick to CVS, because I havent seen any better one so far. and if someone knows a better solution please tell me too. </p>
    <p>PVCS, ClearCase and VSS are the worse ones I have used.. and never willing to work on them again.</p>

<p>I'm no CVS expert, either, but I learned enough in a couple of days to get around doing the basic checkout&#47;add&#47;commit tasks without too much trouble using CVS's command line client.</p></p>
<p>We use VSS at work and, man, you should see me bitch about it every half hour ;) Anyway, I guess I'm looking for a better SCC tool, too, and preferably one that runs on windows, is robust, has IDE integration, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg... yeah, tall order, I know...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
