<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.damieng.com&#47;blog&#47;">Damien Guard</a> shows a few <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.damieng.com&#47;blog&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;04&#47;09&#47;Programming-fonts-you-might-not-have-tried.aspx">other</a>, less well-known&nbsp;monospaced fonts that have potential as&nbsp;programming fonts: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ms-studio.com&#47;FontSales&#47;anonymous.html#">Anonymous</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.urbanfonts.com&#47;fonts&#47;Crystal.htm">Crystal</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.urbanfonts.com&#47;fonts&#47;Onuava.htm">Onuava</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;typo3.org&#47;?id=1942">Share Technical Monospaced</a>. </p>
<p>I used Anonymous a few years back for a few months, back when it was a free download from the Microsoft.com site, and found it pretty usable. It was recommended to me back then by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;win32.mvps.org&#47;">Felix Kazsa</a>.</p>
<p>The other three fonts I gave a cursory look but didn't find them too much to my liking. In particular, both Crystal and Onuava are too elongated in the vertical for my taste, and I found the&nbsp;braces and a few other punctuation symbols a bit too skinny.</p>
<p>One common problem with free fonts, by the way (and this is particularly bad with monospaced fonts) is that they usually only offer a very limited set of characters. Now, I don't need the entire unicode charset, but having at least the basic accented characters used in spanish and german is pretty useful, so&nbsp;this is&nbsp;another consideration to keep in mind when selecting a good programming font.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm back on Consolas for general programming, though lately I've been giving a look again at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gnome.org&#47;fonts&#47;">Bitstream Vera Sans Mono</a>, which is stil a pretty usable font all in all. However, I'm using a derivation from this called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dejavu.sourceforge.net&#47;wiki&#47;index.php&#47;Main_Page">DejaVu Sans Mono</a>.&nbsp; Here's an example:</p>
<p><img height="466" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;OtherProgrammingFonts_6F1A&#47;DejaVuSansMono%5B11%5D.png" width="700"> </p>
<p>By the way, as far as sans serif fonts go, Deja Vu Sans Condensed shows quite a bit of potential in my humble opinion :-)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
