<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I like to use an extended desktop on my laptop for some presentations: extending my desktop along the main LCD and the external projector. It usually worked very well, until Vista. </p>
<p>I noticed today that on vista, extending the desktop itself works just fine, and the new tools to manage it are actually pretty cool (like the configuration screen that pops up as soon as you connect the external projector). The problem is that for some weird reason, windows on the second monitor (extended desktop) refuse to take input focus, so they don't recognize keyboard input and I can barely get them to recognize mouse clicks by double clicking very fast on them (which usually causes the wrong thing to happen).</p>
<p>I wonder if it's something I'm doing wrong of if it's a bug with the video card drivers or what. Anyone else seen this yet?</p>
