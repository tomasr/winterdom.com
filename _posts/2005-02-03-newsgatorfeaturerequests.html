<p><!--start_raw-->Greg is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rassoc.com&#47;gregr&#47;weblog&#47;archive.aspx?post=752">asking</a> for feature request for Newsgator Outlook edition. As a current customer (and a very happy one, fwiw), I do have a few usability-related requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>An easier way to add subscriptions in outlook. Currently, this requires going to the Newsgator Subscription dialog and clicking the Add button; I'd like an Add Subscription entry right there on the newsgator menu that opens up from the toolbar.</li>
<li>A way to subscribe to new feeds from within Firefox, similar to the way you can from Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>A better way for monitoring subscriptions to feeds that are no longer active. In particular, I'd like to see Newsgator, for example, flag feeds that have not been retrieved because of server errors (or feed errors) for X number of consecutive times. This would make it easier to get rid of subscriptions to feeds that now return a 404 or just don't work.</li><br />
</ol><!--end_raw--></p>
