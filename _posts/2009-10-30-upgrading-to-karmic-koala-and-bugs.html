<p>Yesterday afternoon I kicked off the update to Karmic Koala (9.10) on my trusty Dell Latitude D820 laptop that was running Ubuntu 9.04. The update took a long time (mostly due to the servers getting hammered) and, overall, worked just fine.</p>
<p>I did have to struggle with a couple of things. For example, I originally installed that machine with Xubuntu a long time ago and then converted to GNome. The Karmic upgrade enabled Xubuntu as the default again and configured XFCE as the default session, but that&rsquo;s easy enough to fix. I can&rsquo;t seem to find where to change my logon screen to the one I was using, though.</p>
<p>The big issue issues I&rsquo;m running on, however, are related to what I use my machine the most for :(:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had to change some of my scripts for mounting Windows shares in other machines as specifying the rw option to mount was no longer working. No errors, just mounting read-only instead. To fix this, I had to add the file_mode=0777 and dir_mode=0777 options to the mount command. No big deal, but took me a few Google searches to figure it out.</li>
<li>Building C&#47;C++ apps&#47;libraries on a samba share doesn&rsquo;t work anymore, as GCC will always fail with a &ldquo;Value too large for the defined data type&rdquo; error. I&rsquo;m basically hitting the bug described in this <a href="https:&#47;&#47;bugs.launchpad.net&#47;ubuntu&#47;+source&#47;gcc-defaults&#47;+bug&#47;455122">bug report</a>. I do hope it gets fixed soon, as otherwise I will have to get back to 9.04, which does work fine. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll try setting up another VM with 9.04 to see if I can get some work done. Ouch!</li> </ul></p>
