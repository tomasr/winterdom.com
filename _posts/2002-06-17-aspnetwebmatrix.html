    <p>On my work PC (PIII 600, 192MB RAM) it ran pretty slow in comparison to VS.NET.<br &#47;>
    On my home pc which is more beefed up (AMD1.1 1gig RAM), it does run quite smoothly.</p>

    <p>Funny that. On my crappy PII-400MHz with 320MB RAM, it ran much faster than VS.NET....</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->As most of you already know by now, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.asp.net&#47;webmatrix&#47;default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46">ASP.NET WebMatrix</a> (formerly known as Saturn) technology preview was released a couple days ago. I downloaded it today and I must say I'm quite impressed by it! It's small, it's very fast, and seems to have some pretty cool features.</p>
<p>As I basically use VS.NET simply as a souped-up editor (instead relying on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nant.sf.net&#47;">NAnt</a> as a build tool), this is one project I'm gonna keep an eye on! Congratulations to the ASP.NET team on a job <b>well done!</b>.</p></p>
<p><b>P.S.:</b> The new name sucks, but ohh, well, it's not like there's much else to complain about ;)</p><br />
