<p><!--start_raw-->I'm leaving tomorrow early for the MVP Summit. Hopefully, I'll be arriving in seattle tomorrow around 11 pm, which should give me at least a nice one and a half days to unwind and have fun around seattle before the summit officially begins.</p>
<p>I'll be at the Crowne Plaza in downtown seattle. If anyone wants to meet, just ping me at my email (<a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">tomasr@mvps.org</a>) or MSN messenger (tomasr@passport.com).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
