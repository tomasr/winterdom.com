    Well, if you truly don't like the Vista default background there is nothing keeping you from changing it. Go grab a copy of Stardock's Logon Studio (free) and create any background you want.

    Mike: Yes, I'm aware of those products, though not a big fan of them myself (already have way too much crap running on my machine). Actually, my subtle point was that it can be a bit surprising to see how the Windows Server builds sometimes capture things better than the consumer builds do.
    In fact, it's pretty of a surprise (to me at least) how Windows Server keeps getting better and better while the Windows Desktop, well, not so much. XP was OK, but Windows Server 2003 kicked ass. Windows Server 2008 is even better, from what I've seen (IIS7 rocks).

    You'll get no arguments from me on any of your points. I've been running Vista x64 on my office workstation and using the various Windows 2008 Betas&#47;CTPs&#47;RCs on a spare machine for what seems like years now. Now that W2K8 is fully baked that will all be changing and I will repave my workstation with Windows Server as the primary OS and virtualize anything else (I think services developers should be developing&#47;testing on the actual platforms they are coding for anyway). I'll still run Vista Ultimate at home and on my laptop, but the work box is definitely going to get repaved real soon - I just need to find the time to do it.
    And yes, IIS7 totally rocks.

<p>Am I the only one that thinks the Windows Server 2008 logon screen, with it's very simple blue background, is so much better looking that Vista's ugly and distracting "aurora" background?</p>
<p>There's just something highly appealing to me about keeping things simple and elegant...</p>
