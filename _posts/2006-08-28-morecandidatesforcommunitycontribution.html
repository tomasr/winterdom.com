<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>About a month ago <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;08&#47;02&#47;AnOfferOfContributionToACommunityLeaderOSProject.aspx">I posted</a> an offer to the community for a contribution to a community leader of an MVP invite card for a one-year MSDN subscription. I haven't had much interest in this yet, which is why I haven't announced the lucky winner yet.</p>
<p>Come on people! If you've got any ideas or candidates, send them my way!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
