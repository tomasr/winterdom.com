<p><!--start_raw-->I just read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0100136&#47;2002&#47;05&#47;21.html#a184">this</a> discussion between Paul Prescod and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0100136&#47;">Paul Snively</a> regarding Python and several other programming languages.</p>
<p>I find this kind of discussions quite interesting for two reasons: 1) Programming Languages and Compiler design is one of the topics I really like in Computer Science, and 2) they make some very intriguing comparisions between different languages and Lisp. For quite a while I've wanted to get acquainted with other programming languages like Python and Scheme, but so far, I haven't had the time to do so... there's just so many hours each day, ya know. I'd love it if anyone had any pointers on these, though!</p></p>
<p>On a related issue. Paul Graham has a very nice article on Lisp and other languages entitled <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.paulgraham.com&#47;icad.html">"Revenge of the Nerds"</a>. I must admit that while although I've always been intrigued by the power of Lisp, I find the syntax just plain horrible... particularly since I discovered that I couldn't understand crap of what I had written in Lisp half an hour after doing it...</p><br />
