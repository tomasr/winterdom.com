<p><!--start_raw-->So, I've finally gone ahead and started a new <a href="&#47;mcppfaq&#47;">Managed C++ FAQ</a> site. Being the lazy bastard I am, I just created a new MT blog on my site, so the FAQ is going to have somewhat of a weird format. OTOH, the benefits are categorization (not done... yet), and auto-generated RSS feeds (as if anyone cared).</p>
<p>Please note I'm just getting started, so there's not much in yet. However, if anyone feels like they want contribute, I'd really appreciate it! Just let <a href="mailto:tomasr@mvps.org">me know</a>, and I'll set you up with an MT user so you can post directly to the FAQ!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
