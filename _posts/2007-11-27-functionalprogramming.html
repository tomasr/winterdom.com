<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've been trying to learn more about functional programming in general lately, and there's a lot of good stuff around to read on it. Unfortunately for me, a lot of the content on the web on the topic uses <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Haskell_%28programming_language%29">Haskell</a> to explain the concepts, and I find the Haskell syntax to be somewhat intrusive when trying to get a grip on the core concepts. Still, I probably should make a bigger effort in understanding Haskell :-).</p>
<p>While reading up on this topic, I ran across the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;osteele.com&#47;sources&#47;javascript&#47;functional&#47;">Functional Javascript</a> library, which I think is pretty cool. I'm constantly surprised just by how flexible and powerful JS is, and it's a real pity that such a great programming language has been so closely associated with the browser throughout its history. I still suck at JS programming, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the elegance and power some of the libraries and constructs for the language have to offer.</p>
<p>By the way, I've also become a great fan of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;programming.reddit.com&#47;">programming.reddit.com</a>; it's been a very valuable source of interesting links, blogs and articles focusing on dynamic and functional programming, among other topics.</p>
<p>(While on the topic of functional programming, it's good to know I wasn't <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lambda-the-ultimate.org&#47;node&#47;2266">the only one confused</a> by wikipedia's entry on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Currying">currying</a>).</p><br />
<h2>Functional Programming on .NET</h2>
<p>Now that .NET 3.5 has RTM, some of the constructs in C# 3.0 make it possible to adopt a more functional style of programming on C#. Some of it was possible in C# 2.0, but the anonymous delegate syntax was still a bit too cumbersome. The new lambda syntax makes it a lot nicer, easier to read and easier to code (though because of the static typed nature of the language it can still be a bit cumbersome at times). Eric white has a lot of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;ericwhite&#47;pages&#47;FP-Tutorial.aspx">interesting tutorials</a> on functional programming with C# 3.5 and LINQ on his blog, in case you haven't yet run across them.</p>
<p>Obviously F# is <em>the</em> functional programming on .NET for now, and it has tons of really good stuff, though personally I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>I think that, overall, there's ton of good things to learn from other programming paradigms that can helpo make you a better developer even if you're writing your code in a language favoring a more traditional approach. It's certainly very valuable to understand and learn different approaches to problem-solving and incorporate them into your arsenal.</p>
