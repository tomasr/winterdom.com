    <p>Lax shouldn't give you an error it should give you a warning. What version of the .NET Framework are you using? </p>

    <p>Dare: That was it. You are right in that it gives a warning instead of an error (at least in v1.1). The problem was my code wasn't checking ValidationEventArgs.Severity.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->Fumiaki Yoshimatsu points out on a <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000268.html#comments">comment</a> to my <a href="&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000268.html">xs:any post</a> that skip seems to work on .NET 1.1.</p>
<p>I just tried it, and indeed it works and shows no error. Lax still gives me an error, though, which I think should not, either.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
