<p><!--start_raw-->Yesterday, a few of my coworkers got together to give me a present: A copy of Martin Fowler's most recent book <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0321127420">"Patterns of Enterprise Application Integration"</a>. What a great present! This one was at the top of my to-buy list!</p>
<p>Thank you so much to Yenny, Manuel, Gabriel, Hugo and Guillermo for this present! You guys rock!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
