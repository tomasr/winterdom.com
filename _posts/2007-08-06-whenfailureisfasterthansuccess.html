<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Yesterday morning I was going through some client&#47;server code I had written, mostly some custom serialization&#47;deserialization code. The code itself was working fine; I had decent set of unit tests for it. Instead, I was focusing on doing some integration testing as well as taking some measurements of how performance was when large object sets where serialized&#47;deserialized.</p>
<p>The code itself is fairly simple, and although it uses XML as&nbsp;the serialization format, it still is fairly efficient (XmlReader&#47;Writer based code); however I needed to see how other factors would impact it. On the server side, I had built a TextWriter implementation on top of my networking stack, which made kept the code real simple.</p>
<p>In my first test, I tried having it work with a small set of objects. The result? Doing real work 110ms; serializing the results and sending them over the wire? 1100ms. Not very good.</p>
<p>Looking at it a bit more, I realized that the problem was that the underlying networking stack didn't do any buffering at all; if I send 3 bytes, it would send a TCP packet with those 3 bytes right away; since the XmlTextWriter class does a lot of&nbsp;WriteChar() calls on the underlying TextWriter, performance was abysmal.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and implemented a simple buffering scheme inside my TextWriter object, and that worked fine. Second results? Doing real work: 85ms, serializing the results: 120ms.</p>
<p>I then started looking at how it would perform with large object sets (as in like a few thousands of them). My first result? Doing real work: 6640ms, serializing the results? 130ms. That can't be right! Tried it a few more times; with always the same results.</p>
<p>Indeed it wasn't right. Turned out that while I was sending small result sets; all was well because the serialized representation of the objects was smaller than the small buffer size I was testing initially with (about 4KB), but as soon as that went over that number, I started sending larger packages down the network fairly fast and the underlying&nbsp;network library&nbsp;would throw an exception after the second or third package was sent. So indeed, failing was turning out to be faster than succeeding!</p>
<p>I didn't notice the exception that was occurring at first because the serialization code was wrapped with a try&#47;catch block that, if it trapped an exception, would serialize the error information and send it along the wire as well; which was pretty useless as that was precisely what was failing :-).</p>
