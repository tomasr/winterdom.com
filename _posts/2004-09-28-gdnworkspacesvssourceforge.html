<p><!--start_raw-->Craig Andera <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pluralsight.com&#47;blogs&#47;craig&#47;archive&#47;2004&#47;09&#47;28&#47;2448.aspx">posts about the move of FlexWiki</a> from GotDotNet workspaces to Sourceforge.net. All I can say is: Bravo! I so totally agree with Craig: GDN Workspaces are extremely unusable... they are very slow, unreliable (they mostly never worked for me right) and the usability of the overall GDN site is just appalling. Given that, I pretty much ignore any project that is posted to GDN by default, even if it's one I would be very interested in contributing... fighting the tools all the way is not my idea of fun.</p>
<p>Now, Sourceforge ain't perfect, either, but at least they work and don't have all that huge hassle... and getting up and running an contributing (once you know how to join a project, the mail list and access CVS) is fairly quick.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
