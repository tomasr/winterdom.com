<p><!--start_raw-->In response to my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;08&#47;02&#47;AnOfferOfContributionToACommunityLeaderOSProject.aspx">request for candidates</a>, Marcos Meli pointed out his own <a href="http:&#47;&#47;filehelpers.sourceforge.net&#47;">FileHelpers Library</a> project. In his ow words:<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The FileHelpers are an easy to use .NET library written in<br />
C#. Is designed to read&#47;write data from flat files with fixed length or<br />
delimited records (CSV). Also has support to import&#47;export data from different<br />
data storages (Excel, Access, SqlServer) </i></p><br />
I fully intend to take a look at Marcos' work, it certainly fills a very common need (in fact it's something I may consider for a project on the near future). I thing it's worth a look from fellow readers :-)<br>
