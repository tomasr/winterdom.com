<font size="2">Walking up at 3:30 am to get to MIA to catch a ride to dallas. Urgh!<br />
Missed the initial keynote, but managed to grab <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gotdotnet.com&#47;team&#47;dbox&#47;spoutletex.aspx">Don's </a>early<br />
talk, which was quite fun, as Don's talks always are. One interesting thing mentioned<br />
in the talk is WSE 2.0 getting a new programming model allowing explicit access to<br />
the SOAP messages. Will look forward to that one...</font><br />

<font size="2">I'm sitting right now here listening to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.douglasp.com">Doug<br />
Purdy</a> talk about serialization and loose coupling. One interesting comment Doug<br />
brought up is "To achieve loose coupling, you're gonna need to understand XSD". True,<br />
right now at least. But I have to wonder about this for a little bit. Do we actually<br />
need to fully understand XSD? It's pretty complex, and some of the XSD constructs<br />
are pretty obscure. One has to wonder if we only need to understand XSD good enough...<br />
Good as in an XSD subset that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the cost, which<br />
for all practical terms means getting the significant XSD subset that both allows<br />
a decent level of flexibility while easing interoperability. I'm not one to usually<br />
run away from complexity, but I'm not one to freely embrace it unless I see a real<br />
need for it....</font><br />
