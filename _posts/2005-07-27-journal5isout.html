<p><!--start_raw-->Way cool, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;architecture&#47;default.aspx?pid=journal.5&amp;abver=E9A00024-3DC1-4B6A-BC20-22716E4D2FEA">Journal 5</a> is out (as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;bobrien&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;07&#47;25&#47;442936.aspx">others</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;rhughes&#47;archive&#47;2005&#47;07&#47;22&#47;442125.aspx">have</a> reported)! I've enjoyed a lot reading through every one of the previous edition and this one (what I've been able to read so far) is quite interesting, as well.</p>
<p>One minor comment guys: The quality of the images in the web version at least is terrible in some of the articles (particularly the black and white ones, which look like poorly scanned figures), making them very hard to read. It's really a shame, and I hope the print version is better than that!</p><!--end_raw--></p>
