<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0106548&#47;">Ziv Caspi</a> asks in a comment to one of my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000216.html">rants</a>:</p>
<p><i><quote>Is there a good design that would support both?<br />
<br&#47;><br />
Is other words, do you see (or know of) a good design that would please devs like me -- who rarely do UI work and need simple abstractions --yet also support people like you, who obviously need the power to do complex work?<br />
<br&#47;><br />
IMHO, it is sometimes very difficult to achieve this in a single API. In some cases I know of, the results were the design of two separated interfaces. This, of course, also sucks.<br />
</quote></i></p></p>
<p>Great question, and not one easy to answer, I think, since it depends on a lot of factors. However, let me side-step the issue by saying this: I don't think my original critique of the Winforms design impacted the usability of the framework in any way. In fact, I think it would've simplified usage of it.  Would've splitting the class hierarchy in a different way have significantly impacted the usage model? I don't think so. Consistency is always good, at least imho, while we're are it.</p><br />
