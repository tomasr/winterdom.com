<p><!--start_raw-->My good friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;sam.gentile&#47;">Sam Gentile</a> has <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;sam.gentile&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;03&#47;26&#47;141818.aspx">posted</a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;sam.gentile&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;03&#47;26&#47;141814.aspx">links</a> to some of the articles and posts he has written in the past throughout the several incarnations of his weblog. There is some incredible stuff over there, so make sure you read it. <br><br>I've always been impressed with how versatile and knowledgeable Sam is on everything he works on since I first met him online back in 2002 or so, and you owe it to yourself to check everything Sam has written about; you'll be sure to learn a thing or two! My personal favourites are the ones on Agile development and architecture :-)<br>
