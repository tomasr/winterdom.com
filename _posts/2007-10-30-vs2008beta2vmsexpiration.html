    From current download page:
    "The Beta 2 VPC images downloaded before October 29 will expire on November 1, 2007, which is earlier than anticipated. After that time, the VPC will operate for only 1-2 hours before needing to be restarted. This restart can be eliminated by upgrading the underlying installation of Windows Server on the original VPC image. Also, new VPC images have been posted below. "

<p>As most will probably know, turns out the Visual Studio 2008 Virtual Machines had an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;jeffbe&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;27&#47;update-on-expiring-vs2008-beta2-vpcs.aspx">OS expiration date</a> of Nov 1st, so they'll soon stop working. According to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;jeffbe&#47;">Jeff Beehler</a>, the updated VMs have <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;jeffbe&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;30&#47;vs2008-beta2-vpcs-re-released.aspx">been posted</a> for download now.</p>
<p>However, when I visit the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyId=3B72271C-E996-4989-898D-72D684966CE6&amp;displaylang=en">download page</a> linked in his post, the first thing I notice is this big bold announcement:</p>
<p><b>THESE IMAGES WILL EXPIRE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2007. UPDATED IMAGES WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER OCTOBER 29, 2007.</b></p>
<p>So are these the updated files or not? Does anybody know?</p>
<p><b>Update: </b>The page has been updated and it seems the new downloads are really up this time. Fingers crossed ;-)<br></p>
