<p><!--start_raw-->I've been working this weekend on improving my NUnitReport XSLT Template for NAnt, and while doing so, ran into some hard-to-solve problem (hard to me, at least) using keys and trying to find some unique values.</p>
<p>While looking for a solution, I ran into Dave Pawson's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dpawson.co.uk&#47;xsl&#47;xslfaq.html">XSL FAQ</a>, which gave me the ideas I needed to finally crack it (it turns out I was fairly close...). I strongly recommend his site for anyone serious about XSLT and XPath; he's got some really cool examples on it.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
