<p><!--start_raw-->I'm currently reading Luke Homann's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;tg&#47;detail&#47;-&#47;0201775948">"Beyond Software Architecture: Creating and Sustaining Winning Solutions"</a>, and so far, I'm liking it quite a bit, highly recommended reading.</p>
<p>Two things in the book I've liked so far:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Software Architecture as providing a set of <i>capabilites</i> over which <i>features</i> can then be implemented. I think this is a great way of looking at software architecture. While I hadn't used this term before when working on some of our projects and with some of our customers, this concept seems much inline with my thoughts on the matter and how I've approached the technical architecture of the systems I've worked as architect on.</li>
<li>Luke's description of Product Management. This is a topic I know very little of (not surprising, since I've never worked on product-oriented development), and the book has given me a much needed overview of the kind of activities that might be involved here.</li><br />
