    Have you been able to sort out the trouble with VS2005 hanging when typing the '<' inside a CDATA tag? I'm experiencing the same problem, but have not so far figured out why this is happening, or how to solve it.
    Best regards

    Yes!!  I just had that problem!  Wouldn't that be the point of having CDATA available...to put xml that is supposed to come out as a string literal?  I had to kill the process and lost some code.  I've had WAY TOO MANY issues with VS 2005.  2003 wasn't near this bad.  Hopefully 2008 fixes this stuff.
    An interesting point: should this worry us about using Microsoft's XML parser?

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>&nbsp;While working on my PipelineTesting library code, I'm running into a pretty annoying problem: Visual Studio will hang (with 100% processor usage) every time I try to type a '<' inside a <![CDATA[]]> section in an XML comment (specifically inside the <example&#47;> tag).</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this before? This is VS2005 with SP1, btw, running on Windows Server 2003.</p>
