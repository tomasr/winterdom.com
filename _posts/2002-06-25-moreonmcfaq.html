<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0105852&#47;2002&#47;06&#47;25.html#a607">Sam</a> says: <i>"Judging from how much you helped me during the book, I bet you and I could start one. How about it?"</i>.</p>
<p>I thought about it, but <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cookcomputing.com&#47;">Charles</a> wrote me and said he had been working on one for the past few days... However, I'm thinking we all probably have different things we want to say, so, why not join efforts all three? I think together (along with anybody else interested), we could probably get something good running in no time (heck, I've got four or five different useful entries written up already).</p><!--end_raw--></p>
