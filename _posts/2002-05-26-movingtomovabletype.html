<p><!--start_raw-->I've been looking into improving my blogging system, but I certainly don't want to go<br />
all the way up to Radio (I <i>really</i> don't need it, nor do I like it's publishing<br />
system... but hey, that's just me!). After seeing<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cookcomputing.com">Charles Cook</a> looking into<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.movabletype.org&#47;">Movable Type</a>, I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Had to fumble my way around the installation, but the help was pretty good.<br />
I've already got it running on the server, and will try in the next few days to import<br />
my current entries... I actually liked it quite a bit. I don't like breaking all<br />
current links though, which would be a pita to deal with later :( </p></p>
<p>I still have to play a little with it, but I'd love it if I could get it to<br />
play nicely with my ASP.NET templates I currently use for my blog<br />
(and the rest of the site, for that matter). So I'll keep playing with it for<br />
a few days until I feel ready to do a full migration....Now, don't get me wrong,<br />
I <i>like</i> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.blogger.com&#47;">Blogger</a>, as it offers pretty<br />
much all I needed... I really just want a few more toys to play with ;)</p><br />
