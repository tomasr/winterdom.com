<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've been writing a simple (but important for me) Web Application these past few days using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;monorail&#47;">Monorail</a>, and I will just say <em>it totally rocks</em>. Getting started with a monorail project, without using any wizard is actually pretty easy; I started by getting the most recent successful build. I was able to get the basic boilerplate code, even supporting localization, in very little time, and I've been very happy with just how simple and intuitive it is overall.</p>
<p>The only problem I had a bit was with documentation, as it seems to be a little older and doesn't quite match now. For example, the wiki entries for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.castleproject.org&#47;index.php&#47;MonoRail:Brail">Brail</a> view engine (which I prefer over the nvelocity one) suggest templates and layouts should be named with a *.boo extension, when it should be *.brail. </p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, writing brail templates in&nbsp;Visual Studio&nbsp;sucks :-)... if you open the files using the HTML editor it works, but it is <em>too helpful</em> in reformatting the code, resulting in broken boo snippets.</p>
