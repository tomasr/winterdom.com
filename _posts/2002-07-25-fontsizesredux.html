<p><!--start_raw-->Drew <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0104813&#47;2002&#47;07&#47;24.html#a139">says</a>: <i>"The font-family should not matter"</i>. I wished.</p>
<p>That has, unfortunately, not been my experience. The basic problem with Verdana and IE is that the differences between one relative size and the next are sometimes <b>Huge</b>, which makes them using very annoying. I'm definitely following Brad's advice of using EM for the font sizes and avoid small&#47;x-large&#47;etc. Expect something Monday-ish.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
