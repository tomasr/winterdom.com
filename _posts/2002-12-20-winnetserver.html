<p>Yep, gotta agree. Win.NET Server is way cool. I had a chance to see quite a few of its features in action at the .NET Server DevCon back in september, which was way cool; not only because of the demos, but also because I got a chance to meet and talk again with several MS people (including a few of the people from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;visualc&#47;">Visual C++</a> Team, whom I consider good friends).</p></p>
<p>Highlight of the week was when <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;~Gray&#47;">Jim Gray</a> sat at the table I was eating lunch, shortly after he had delivered his presentation. Got to hear him talking about tons of interesting stuff (even better since I had just begun reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;1558601902">one</a> of his books!)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
