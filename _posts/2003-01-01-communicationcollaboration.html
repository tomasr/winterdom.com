<p><!--start_raw-->I read with interest Sam's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0105852&#47;2002&#47;12&#47;30.html#a1661">thoughts on collaboration</a> and the discussion that started from there. It's interesting because its something that I agree with, but, alas, don't have an easy solution to, either.</p>
<p>Something I find even more interesting is the fact that while working around a project might work well and build a collaboration environment, not always does it also mean that a real community might appear from there. For example, some Open-Source projects I've worked on have been very succesful (at least imho) and collaborating on them was great, but not much community (at least as I see it). Whether that's good or bad I still don't know.</p></p>
<p>Something else that really caught my eye in Sam's piece was his comment that "<quote> seems very difficult to get people to collaborate freely and consitently in a medium where they feel like they have an obligation</quote>". While I agree in principle, I also find it ironic that when collaboration is built around a project, then the <i>obligation to contribute</i> is almost implied by definition [1]. To be able to collaborate to a project, you <i>need</i> to do <i>something</i>. Else, how are you collaborating?</p></p>
<p>[1] Note that this doesn't necessarily mean contributing code</p><!--end_raw--></p>
