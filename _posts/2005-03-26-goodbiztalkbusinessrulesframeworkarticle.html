<p><!--start_raw-->Someone posted a link to a recent article on MSDN on the Business Rules Framework in BizTalk Server 2004: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.msdn.microsoft.com&#47;library&#47;default.asp?url=&#47;library&#47;en-us&#47;bts_2004wp&#47;html&#47;87e1b104-c39c-4b0d-a74e-494d672e9779.asp">"Risk Scoring with BizTalk Server 2004 and the Business Rules Framework"</a>. Good introduction to the BR component in BizTalk, which is a welcome addition to the product.</p>
<p>One cool thing about the article is that I can relate to the sample business case, since as part of one of the last projects I worked on we implemented a financial risk assesment application in .NET for one of our largest customers (a bank), so I found it quite illustrative from that side, as well.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
