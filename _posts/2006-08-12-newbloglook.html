<p><!--start_raw-->I've just uploaded and configured my new theme 'Commonality2' for my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;">weblog</a>. I had been wanting to change my weblog's look and feel for a while now, but only recently did I get any ideas as to the new look I wanted. It's a fairly simple, sober style, which is what I prefer.<br><br>Any comments, good or bad, are appreciated :)<br>
