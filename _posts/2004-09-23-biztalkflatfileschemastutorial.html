<p><!--start_raw-->I always get confused about the meaning of the properties for the Flat File schema designer extensions in BizTalk Server, so I decided to write a small <a href="&#47;dev&#47;bts&#47;BTSFFSchemaTut1.html">tutorial</a> on creating a simple delimited flat file schema for a CSV format that guides you through the necessary steps. I'll probably improve it and add a few other things as needed, so it's not perfect, but hopefully someone will find it useful.<!--end_raw--></p>
