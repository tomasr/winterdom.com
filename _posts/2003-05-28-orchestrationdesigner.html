    <p>Misunderstood the screenshot then. There is interactive debugging in the new BizTalk stuff. I'd post a couple of screenshots but that'd probably be a violation of something or other.</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->On a comment to my earlier <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;archives&#47;000295.html">entry</a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.slavin.org&#47;">Sean</a> mentions Biztalk's Orchestration Designer. I haven't seen what's on the Biztalk 2004's OD, but at least the one on 2002 is far different than what I showed in my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;images&#47;Collaxa.JPG">screenshot</a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.collaxa.com&#47;">Collaxa's</a> BPEL Server.</p>
<p>What I showed on my earlier screenshot was not how to design BPEL flows for Collaxa, but rather their tracing and debugging console, which allows you to visualize an <i>instance</i> of the flow in a graphical representation, see what actions have been executed, what messages have been sent and what has been received, and so on. This is, imho, a very easy to use and very powerful tool, far beyond the design-time only experience Biztalk's Orchestration Designer offered.</p></p>
<p>But if that changes for the next release of biztalk, well, all for the better :)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
