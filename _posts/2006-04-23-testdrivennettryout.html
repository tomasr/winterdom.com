<p><!--start_raw--></p>
<p>It has been sometime since I had tried <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.testdriven.net&#47;">TestDriven.NET</a> out (I've been using the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nunit.org&#47;">NUnit</a> GUI meanwhile). However, I decided to<br />
download and try again the latest TestDriven.NET build alongside Visual Studio<br />
2005, and it has worked wonderfully. Thanks to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;NUnitAddin&#47;">Jamie Cansdale</a> for putting<br />
together such an amazing tool.</p></p>
<p>Several reasons why I like it:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>It's fast. Far, far faster than the Visual Studio Team System integrated<br />
unit testing tools. Running a single test method, a single fixture or an<br />
entire assembly full of tests is a piece of cake.</p>
<li>It works with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nunit.org&#47;">NUnit</a>, which I prefer to<br />
the integrated testing tools in VSTS for this.</p>
<li>The support for Code Coverage rocks. Worked like a charm for me right<br />
away.</p>
<li>Running tests in the debugger is trivial.
<li>Did I mention it is fast?</li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>My only wish right now for TD.NET is a red-green window, i.e. a results pane<br />
where you can see easily (with the usual red&#47;green colors) what tests passed and<br />
which didn't. Right now, TD.NET integrated nicely with the Output and Error List<br />
window in VS, but I would much rather take a quick look at the colors than have<br />
to sort out the output in the error list window (which can be inconvinient<br />
sometimes). I don't think I'm gonna put this one down for a long time. I know<br />
this will not be news for most of you, but I just had to say how much I liked it<br />
:-)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
