    <p>I'm curious, I've heard only good things about Win .NET Server so far. What are you liking about it from a developers POV?</p>
    <p>Cheers</p>

<p><!--start_raw-->I know I haven't posted anything in a while. The reason? Well, I don't think I had anything of importance to say. However, I haven't been inactive, either, so here's what I've been up to lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picked up again on my reading of "Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques", by Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter. (I also had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Gray's presentation at the Server DevCon last month and really enjoyed it!)</li>
<li>Working hard (worked all Saturday and Sunday with a co-worker doing heavy refactoring of our core code... thank god today's a holiday here!)</li>
<li>I've been working on porting some sample code I had lying around from the VS.NET beta 1 days over to RTM</li>
<li>Trying out a few things on Windows .NET Server RC1, and really liking it so far</li><br />
</ul><br />
