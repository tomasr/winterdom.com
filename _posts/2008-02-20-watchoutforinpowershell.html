    Have you tried this?
    PS>dir c:\a*
    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\
    Mode           LastWriteTime       Length Name
    ----           -------------       ------ ----
    -a---      2&#47;8&#47;2008  2:55 PM          439 asec.vbs
    -a---     9&#47;18&#47;2006  2:43 PM           24 autoexec.bat
    PS>cat c:\autoexec.bat
    REM Dummy file for NTVDM
    PS>${c:\autoexec.bat}
    REM Dummy file for NTVDM

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>Here's something that tripped me the other day in a Windows PowerShell script. Let's say that you have to variables $user and $machine, and want to print a string with the value of both of them separated by a colon (':'). </p>
<p>You can obviously do it using string concatenation:</p>
<div class="codebg"><code><span class="Identifier">$user</span> = <span class="Constant">'tomasr'</span>     <br &#47;><span class="Identifier">$machine</span> = <span class="Constant">'arcano'</span>     <br &#47;>    <br &#47;>write (<span class="Identifier">$user</span> + <span class="Constant">':'</span> + <span class="Identifier">$machine</span>) </code></div>
<p>That works, but doesn't PowerShell support that nice string interpolation feature? Why, yes it does! So why don't we just rewrite it like this:</p>
<div class="codebg"><code>write <span class="Constant">"$user:$machine"</span>   </code></div>
<p>But wait! If you run that last line, all you get is the value of the $machine variable... where did $user go?</p>
<p>The answer is that the colon has a special meaning in PowerShell variable names: It's used to associate the variable with a specific <em>scope</em> or namespace. There are a few scopes defined by PowerShell, such as script and global; so for example a global variable might be named $global:var.</p>
<p>But haven't we also seen that syntax elsewhere? Sure, how about $env:PATH? Same thing; except here env isn't a scope by itself, but a PSDrive. So the part before the ':' can either be either an actual scope defined by PS or a PSDrive. Heck, you can even try something like "${c:autoexec.bat}" and watch the magic happen!</p>
<p>So the problem with our string interpolation is that when PowerShell sees "$user:$machine", it expects to find a scope&#47;psdrive named 'user' and expects a variable name to follow the ':', but '$' isn't valid, and 'user' isn't a scope or a PSDrive either, which confuses PowerShell a bit. But since he's too much of a gentleman he just fixes it up as best as he can and ignores everything up to this point and just dumps $machine without complaining. Nice of him, but it can really trip you up if you don't expect it!</p>
<p>Can we avoid this? Yes, we can, by simply delimiting variable names exactly for PowerShell by using '{}', like this:</p>
<div class="codebg"><code>write <span class="Constant">"${user}:$machine"</span>  </code></div>
<p>Section 5.8 on page 141 of Bruce Payette's excellent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Windows-PowerShell-Action-Bruce-Payette&#47;dp&#47;1932394907&#47;">Windows PowerShell in Action</a> covers the topic of variables in PowerShell and gave me the clue to work around this issue.</p>
