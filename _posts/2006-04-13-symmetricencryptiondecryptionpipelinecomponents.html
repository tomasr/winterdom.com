    Toms,
    I am a newbie to biztalk, I tried your encryption&#47;decryption component with some success today, thanx for putting it for us. But I've few confusions where I got stuck using it.
    1. When I make a SSO Configuration Application after running your application, it is made successfully, but when I try to open it, it breaks giving this error:
    "The mapping does not exist. For Config Store applications, the config info has not been set".
    2. What I did then was, Generated the keys, and then tried to save it, which gave me this error:
    "The parameter is incorrect" at store.SetConfigInfo() method.
    I worked around this, by hard coding the appName argument in the method to the config application I just made using the same form. It worked!
    3. I then provided that applications name, in the send pipeline components SSOConfigAppName and deployed it.
    4. It worked and it encrypted the outgoing message.
    5. Now how do I decrypt that message to use it any application, would I need to use the same dll, that I used in Biztalk for that? and what about the errors I got mentioned in point 2 and 3, how can I get rid of them?
    I'd be very grateful to you, if you take bit of your time out and answer my queries.
    Thanks and Regards,
    Sajid.

    Number 1 sounds like a permissions issue, maybe.  Number 2 is strange, definitely haven't seen those myself. It might be something in the name you're using, perhaps? What name are you giving to your SSO application?
    As to number 5, what you'd need is for the other application to decrypt the message using the same algorithm you encrypted it with, and the same set of keys. It is not necessary to actually use the same DLL;  as long as you're choosing the right options you can do it using the standard .NET crypto classes (which are what my pipeline components use underneath, anyway).

    Tomas,
    Thanks for the reply,
    I am trying the code given at http:&#47;&#47;support.microsoft.com&#47;kb&#47;307010
    to Decrypt the messages encrypted using your components, using the DES algorithm. But it just doesn't work, although both are using the same algo.
    1. The key that is generated by your utility is not accepted by this program, it says its size is not valid.
    2. When I generate a key using that program, and try to make a SSO app using your utility with that key, your utility says its invalid.
    So they dont seem to be using the same type of key. Can you please have a look at that code, and tell me how can I decrypt messages encrypted by your component using it Or give me some code which I can use in an application, to decrypt&#47;encrypt messages encrypted&#47;decrypted by your component.

    The code above and my own code don't represent the keys in the same format. My utility presents keys as a set of bytes presented in hexadecimal format; the utilities presented in the link you mention expect the keys to be simple strings that they then convert to bytes directly using an encoding (i.e. based on the ASCII codes of the characters in the string). Two completely different things. You need to handle them the same.

    How do you get around the issue of having an ascii key?  Can I convert the ascii key that I have?  Or can I comment out the hexadecimal check?

    Glenn,
    If you want to allow the user to enter any text as the password, just modify the config tool to use Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes() on the text or something like that.

    Just use the Winforms utility included in the zip... it can create the SSO application to store the keys, generate and save the keys, and then just specify the name of the SSO application in the pipeline component configuration.

<p><!--start_raw--><P>I just finished with an initial implementation of a custom encryption&#47;decryption pipeline component for BizTalk Server 2006, which supports all the symmetric cryptography algorithms included with the .NET Framework's System.Security.Cryptography package: RC2, Rijndael, DES and 3DES.</P><br />
<P>Included in the component are both an encoder and decoder pipeline components so that you can both encrypt and decrypt messages from your custom pipelines. The encoder component does its work in a fully streaming fashion, while the decoder component decrypts into an intermediate in-memory buffer for now (see <A href="&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;11&#47;DecodingComponentsAndStreams.aspx">this</A> for the reason).</P><br />
<P>For both encoder&#47;decoder components, you just have to configure two different properties: </P><br />
<P><IMG height=64 alt=CryptoComp_Pipeline.png src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;binary&#47;CryptoComp_Pipeline.png" width=308 border=0></P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI><EM>Algorithm:</EM> Specifies the symmetric crypto algorithm to encrypt&#47;decrypt messages.<br />
<LI><EM>SsoConfigApp:</EM> Specifies the name of a Configuration Application in the Enterprise Single Sign-On ConfigStore that contains the Key and Initialization Vector to use for encryption&#47;decryption. This way keys are stored securely inside the SSODB database.</LI></UL><br />
<P>Initially, I thought about using Jon Flander's <A href="http:&#47;&#47;www.masteringbiztalk.com&#47;blogs&#47;jon&#47;PermaLink,guid,6e4b84db-d15f-45e9-b245-08b1eb6c4def.aspx">excellent utility</A> for storing configuration data in the SSO, but finally decided to code my own to avoid external dependencies (something I usually try to do for pipeline components as it makes deployment easier). Coding my own allowed me to also add a few things that should simplify deployment somewhat.</P><br />
<P>I provide a sample WinForms application that you can use to create&#47;open&#47;update&#47;delete ConfigApps in the SSO to store keys and IVs securely. The application has the following features:</P><br />
<P><IMG height=396 alt=CryptoComp_Config.png src="http:&#47;&#47;winterdom.com&#47;binary&#47;CryptoComp_Config.png" width=461 border=0></P><br />
<OL><br />
<LI>The ConfigApp in SSO is created as a Config Store application, with two custom fields: CryptoKey and CryptoIV. Both are stored as Base64-encoded strings.<br />
<LI>The utility uses WMI to query the names of the BizTalk Administrators Group and the names of the user groups associated to each BizTalk Host. The admin and users groups in the SSO&nbsp;application are set to these values. I take advantage to a feature in SSO 3.0 which allows you to associate multiple groups as users of the SSO Application, so this way you don't need to create a new group just to have all application and isolated hosts access to the configuration data.<br />
<LI>Both the Key and IV as entered as a long string of hexadecimal digits. If you don't want to write your own, you can use the Generate buttons to automatically generate a Key&#47;IV pair appropriate for the selected symmetric algorithm, which is done via the GenerateKey() and GenerateIV() methods of the specified SymmetricAlgorithm-derived class.<br />
<LI>Some basic validations are done on the key and IV you enter, such as ensuring it has a valid length according to the selected algorithm.</LI></OL><br />
<P>You can download the code for this component <A href="&#47;dev&#47;bts&#47;EncryptionPipelineSol.zip">here</A>. Included in the solution are both the pipeline component and the Winforms configuration application, as well as a messaging-only sample use of both encoder and decoder components.</P><br />
<P></P><!--end_raw--></p>
