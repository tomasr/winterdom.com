    I've been using VPC2007 for awhile and haven't had any issues. You can also use Virtual Server 2005 R2 on Vista as well.

    Bryant,
    Thanks! I prefer not to use Virtual Server, as I really don't like the whole IIS-based administration console (nor do I have to want to run IIS on my main desktop; that's one of the reasons I keep my dev environments virtual).
    Brad Wilson also told me he hasn't had any significant issues with VPC2007, so I'll probably give that a try.

<p>More product releases: Following Vista and Office 2007 RTM last week, we now have the 1.0 release of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;powershell&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;11&#47;14&#47;windows-powershell-1-0-released.aspx">Windows Powershell</a>. Pretty cool. Look forward to installing that to use as my main console.</p>
<p>On a related note, just finished downloading the Office 2007 products from MSDN last night (Office Professional + OneNote + Project + Visio + InfoPath). I'm thinking whether to install them on my main WinXP installation replacing the previous B2TR I have on, or if it's worth waiting for Vista to be available to repave my machine to use with Vista. That would at the least require trying the Virtual PC 2007 beta to run my development environments (all virtual machines), which is probably the part that makes me most nevous. Anyone tried VPC2007 yet? How stable is it?</p>
