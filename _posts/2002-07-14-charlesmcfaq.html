<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cookcomputing.com&#47;blog&#47;archives&#47;000107.html#000107">Charles</a> says: <i>"The MC++ FAQ should follow sometime soon. While working on this I discovered another CLR feature supported by MC++ and not by C# (see earlier entry here) but again its not going to cause a rush to MC++. You'll have to read the FAQ to find out what it is, unless Tomas' FAQ has already mentioned it."</i></p>
<p>Well, I must admit I haven't updated my FAQ much, yet, but I'm working on it... it's just I've been getting pretty busted at night from work. As for that mistery feature, well, hey! I'm no mind-reader.... I honestly have no clue what you're thinking about ;)</p><!--end_raw--></p>
