    <p>I posted on InfoPath on my blog last week (see link)... I'm not terribly impressed with the execution...</p>
---
<p><!--start_raw-->I finished downloading InfoPath yesterday from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;subscriptions&#47;resources&#47;subdwnld.asp">MSDN Subscriber downloads</a>, but with deadlines due today, I haven't had time to give it the spin it deserves... yet.</p>
<p>I must admit, though, that what little I've seen has quite impressed me, and I find the concept very interesting and with a lot of potential.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
