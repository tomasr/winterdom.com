<p><!--start_raw--><a href="http:&#47;&#47;radio.weblogs.com&#47;0105852&#47;">Sam's</a> musings on SciFi books made me think again about my all-time favorite SciFi books of all times. My personal favorites would be, after some hard choices, the entire <font color="maroon">Dune Saga</font> (Frank Herbert) and Isaac Asimov's <font color="maroon">The End of Eternity</font>.</p>
<p>Among shorter SciFi stories, one I particularly liked (although I'm still not completely shure why) is Brian Stableford's <i>Mortimer Gray's History of Death</i>, which was published in the 1996 "The year's best science fiction, thirteenth annual collection".</p><br />
