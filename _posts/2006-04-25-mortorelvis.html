<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;scott.bellware&#47;">Scott Bellware</a> has<br />
written a pretty lengthy piece called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;scott.bellware&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;25&#47;143303.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage">"Mort<br />
or Elvis? A Question for a Bygone Era"</a> (found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;sam.gentile&#47;archive&#47;2006&#47;04&#47;25&#47;143336.aspx">via</a><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;sam.gentile&#47;default.aspx">Sam</a>). If you<br />
haven't already, go read it. Now. It's an excellent, thought-provoking piece,<br />
well worth reading.</p></p>
<p>I find myself agreeing with a lot Scott mentioned. I think he nails it with<br />
his&nbsp;opinion that the Microsoft personas used for VS product planning just<br />
don't stand up to reality. People just don't work that way, and it was probably<br />
that kind of thinking that got us stuff such as the "Architects do not test"<br />
debate. Furthermore, as he mentions, the whole Elvis vs. Mort rivality doesn't<br />
work, because both personas, as presented by Microsoft, leave a lot to be<br />
desired and are really disfunctional team members:</p></p>
<p><em>"I don't think that Mort is ultimately focused on delivering business<br />
value out of some force of discipline, but because without much capacity for<br />
more than quickly hacking out an unsustainable <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Big_Ball_Of_Mud" target="_blank">ball of<br />
mud</a>, he merely provides the appearance of being focused on getting a<br />
business solution done.
<p>Elvis and Einstein, on the other hand, are storied to be trying to solve<br />
software development woes through first building yet another home-grown,<br />
all-encompassing framework - an exercise in futility often equal to betting the<br />
farm on software success through expensive tools for inexpensive<br />
Morts."</em></p></p>
<p>To be fair, I do think up to a point that perhaps the whole Mort vs.<br />
Elvis&#47;Einstein affair was a derivative of a decade old-rivarly in DevDiv: The<br />
whole VC++ vs. VB debate lives on today in the personas roles. It is also a<br />
derivative of what has been a duality of the customer base for Visual Studio:<br />
Commercial Software Developers vs. Business-Software Development (i.e. custom<br />
made software and business solutions), which have, up to a point, always had<br />
somewhat different requirements, at least as seen by Microsoft. I would say that<br />
DevDiv has a pretty nasty multiple-personality disorder, and the transitioning<br />
from a cost center to a profit center and the focus on just how much we can<br />
charge people for semi-working tools doesn't help quite at all. Fortunately, the<br />
development ecosystem in the community on the MS world has evolved enough to at<br />
least supply (or cover up the failings) of that same product set (NAnt, NUnit,<br />
TestDriven.NET and the multitude of publicly available tools and libraries).</p></p>
<p>I have Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite installed on my machine right now, and I<br />
will admit I don't use 10% of it's features, if at all. I use it as<br />
a&nbsp;decent text editor and build system (now that with MSBuild we at least<br />
have a decent project system). I use some of the refactoring tools in the IDE<br />
and the ASP.NET and Winforms visual designers, but none of the Architect&#47;Testing<br />
tools, which I find rather lacking, personally, and just don't seem to fit the<br />
kind of work I'm doing right now. </p></p>
<p><em>"Software development isn't too hard.&nbsp; Software development is<br />
fun.&nbsp; It's a challenge - of that there's no doubt.&nbsp; And sometimes it's<br />
a tiger that won't be tamed.&nbsp; But software is never fun when it's<br />
undertaken on a traditional team in a traditional organization that is hell-bent<br />
on sticking to antiquated value systems and practice systems that have rarely<br />
produced the kinds of successful products and people that practice systems like<br />
Extreme Programming produce."</em></p></p>
<p>In defense of my proffesion, I will say that I totally agree with Scott that<br />
software development should be fun. And a project were<br />
anticuated,&nbsp;never-functional&nbsp;rules and paper processes are more<br />
important than common sense and getting things done is a living hell. Been<br />
there, done that, I don't want to go back. Ever.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
