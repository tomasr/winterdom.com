    I use this full-time as I work on various projects and would forget to siwtch between tabs and whitespace if left off which would annoy the other devs no-end...
    Would be great if that option was stored in the .proj file.

    I never use this feature nor could I ever use it. When I am working with Fixed Witdth Files I've found this little program called FileViewer or something that would show everything I need.

<p>Quick question: How many of you use the 'View White Space' feature in Visual Studio?</p>
<p>In case you're not familiar with it, this feature makes the VS code&#47;text editor display a small dot everywhere there's a space and a small square at the end of the file, thus making it easier to visualize white space. Here's how it usually looks:</p>
<p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="102" alt="Whitespace" src="&#47;weblog&#47;content&#47;binary&#47;WindowsLiveWriter&#47;ShowWhitespace_1253F&#47;Whitespace_3.png" width="554" border="0"> </p>
<p>The 'View White Space' feature can be activated through the Edit -> Advanced -> View White Space menu option, or using the Ctrl+R, Ctrl+W key combination (at least on my keyboard layout).</p>
<p>Personally, I only use this very rarely, though I admit it is occasionally useful, for example when working with positional flat files. I do wonder, is there any of you that uses it full time while coding?</p>
