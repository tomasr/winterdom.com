<p><!--start_raw-->Am I right in assuming that the September CTP of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyId=C20CC6C8-1F4E-4A5C-BC79-C2FE9ABE69AA&amp;displaylang=en">WinFX</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?familyid=7096d039-2638-4f63-8654-d2e5d98fa417&amp;displaylang=en">related tools</a>, despite having the same denomination as the recently released <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lab.msdn.microsoft.com&#47;vs2005&#47;">VS2005</a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;sql&#47;2005&#47;productinfo&#47;ctp.mspx">SQL 2005</a> builds, actually requires VS2005 Beta 2?</p>
<p>It is not obviously apparent from looking at the download pages (heck, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;windowsvista&#47;building&#47;workflow&#47;">WWF page</a> actually says it needs VS2005 Beta 1!).</p></p>
<p>If this is so, then, I'm disappointed... I was looking forward to being able to get rid of beta 2 completely, as it is just way too slow and buggy as all hell :(</p><!--end_raw--></p>
