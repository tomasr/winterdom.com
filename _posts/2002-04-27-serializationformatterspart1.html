<p><font color="#669933">Why the Formatter class sucks</font></p></p>
<p>If you've ever planned on writing a <a href="ms-help:&#47;&#47;MS.VSCC&#47;MS.MSDNVS&#47;cpguide&#47;html&#47;cpconserializationformatters.htm"><br />
Serialization Formatter</a> for .NET, chances are you've taken a look at the <a href="ms-help:&#47;&#47;MS.VSCC&#47;MS.MSDNVS&#47;cpref&#47;html&#47;frlrfSystemRuntimeSerializationFormatterClassTopic.htm"><br />
Formatter</a> class in the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace.</p></p>
<p>The docs on Formatter say:<br&#47;><br />
<quote><font face="Courier New"><br />
"<i><b>Formatter</b> is the abstract (<b>MustInherit</b> in Visual Basic) base<br />
class for all runtime serialization formatters, and provides some helper<br />
methods for implementing the IFormatter interface. The <b>Formatter</b> also<br />
manages queuing objects for serialization and generating IDs on a per-object<br />
basis.</i>"</font><br />
</quote></p></p>
<p>That sounds pretty sweet, doesn't it? Only problem is, the Formatter class is<br />
pretty much useless for writing even the least complex formatters. So, the<br />
first tip into writing your own formatter is <b>don't use the Formatter class</b><br />
as the base of your serializer.</p></p>
<div align="left">
<p align="left">You might be wondering why... Here's why:</p></p>
<ul align="left">
<li align="left">
The Formatter class only provides actual help for writing the <i>serialization</i><br />
code, but pretty much no help at all for writing the deserialization code.</li></p>
<li>
It leads you towards developing all serialization and deserialization code in a<br />
single class, which, for any non-trivial formatter, is going to end up in<br />
way-to-complex, hard-to-maintain code.</li></p>
<li>
Many formatters will need to deal explicitly with serializing special (and very<br />
common) types, such as String. Well, guess what? Formatter doesn't consider the<br />
String type to be special at all, so you're likely going to end up writing a<br />
special case for it in <code>WriteObjectRef()</code>.</li></p>
<li>
This one is even uglier: Formatter gives you some support for dealing with<br />
object ID's and how they are serialized&#47;deserialized, via the <code>Schedule()</code><br />
and <code>GetNext()</code> members. This is sweet, but lacks one interesting<br />
bit: There's no way to reset the ID Generator (an instance of the<br />
ObjectIDGenerator class), so if a user of your Formatter-based Formatter<br />
(pardon the pun!) calls Serialize() twice on the same formatter instance,<br />
objects are handled incorrectly, since if you try to write two object graphs<br />
that contain the same object instance to two different Stream objects, the<br />
second time the common object <i>won't be serialized</i> since the Formatter<br />
will assume it has already been written!<br />
</li></p>
<li>
And finally, the biggest warning light against using the Formatter class is<br />
that, despite what the documentation says, <i>no actual Serialization Formatters<br />
included with the framework do it!</i>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</div></p>
<p>In other words, implement IFormatter <i>directly</i>. In a next post I'll show<br />
you how to implement a simple helper class to deal with object scheduling<br />
during serialization in such a way that will it very easy and will give you<br />
most of the interesting support Formatter already gives you, without any of the<br />
pain...</p><!--end_raw--></p>
