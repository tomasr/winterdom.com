<p><!--start_raw-->While doing some work with nullable types in .NET 2.0 (a very nice feature overall), I ran into a very annoying limitation of System.Nullable<T>: It doesn't implement IComparable or IComparable<T>. Don't know how I missed this one before! <br><br>I guess I can understand why it doesn't, but, in retrospect, I would've preffered Nullable<T> had constrained T so that it could implement the comparison interfaces properly particularly since 99% of the types you'd use Nullable<T> with anyway already support them (meaning all primitive value types in the framework and the rest of the pretty basic ones).<br><br>Oh well, live and learn...<br>
