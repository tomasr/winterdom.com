<p><!--start_raw-->I had been having problems with my cable modem internet access since friday night (the damn thing kept connecting and disconnecting from the network every couple of minutes).</p>
<p>Around noon today (yep, on a Sunday), the guys came in to check it after I called Support, and replaced the old Com21 DoxPort 1110 I had since last year for a Samsung InfoRanger. Everything seems to be working now... </p><!--end_raw--></p>
