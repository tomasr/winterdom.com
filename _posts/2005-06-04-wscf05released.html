<p><!--start_raw-->My good friend <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;cweyer">Christian Weyer</a> and the fellows at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thinktecture.com">Thinktecture</a> have released version 0.5 of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thinktecture.com&#47;Resources&#47;Software&#47;WSContractFirst&#47;default.html">WSCF</a>.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting release I've been expecting for a while now (I was one of the lucky testers of beta versions of it), and I promise you'll be excited about it as well once you check out all the cool new features. My current favourites are: Separate File code generation, the new doc page generated for the services (similar to the standard ASMX one), multiple schema file support and the use of interfaces for code generation.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
