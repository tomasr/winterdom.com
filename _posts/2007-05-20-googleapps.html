<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>On friday, I moved winterdom.com's email over to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;a">Google Apps</a>. The switch was actually very painless, mostly consisting of just a&nbsp;few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up with Google Apps</li>
<li>Modify the default Google Apps URLs for the domain in the control panel</li>
<li>Create DNS entries for email and other stuff.</li></ul>
<p>It's been working pretty nicely so far, and the whole change took efect within a half hour of having signed up and making the DNS changes. I really don't care much about the calendar and other stuff, mostly about email. The reason being two-fold: a) my host's email, while it usually worked, ocassionally went offline and usually was very slow for receiving and sending messages over POP3 and SMTP and b) I was just getting too much spam, and gmail's filters are very effective, which is a big plus.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pretty happy with the change :-).</p>
