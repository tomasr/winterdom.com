    I have this same issue with the scroll after resuming from hibernate.  I go to the device manager and siable the mouse, then re enable it and the scroll works fine again.
    Have you found a solution?

<p><!--start_raw-->
<p>I've talked a bit about some issues in the latest <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;weblog&#47;2006&#47;12&#47;10&#47;NewMSHardwareDrivers.aspx">Intellipoint release on Vista</a>. One issue that some people had reported and that I definitely experienced as well was that Intellipoint prevented the screensaver from kicking in unless the workstation was locked.</p>
<p>A few days ago I saw an optional update on Windows update for "Microsoft - Other Hardware - HID Non-User Input Data Filter" and installed it. I'm not quite sure what it did, but I'm happy to report it seems to have fixed the screensaver issue.</p>
<p>Now, if they posted an update for the vertical scrolling speed issue (the one where the scroll-wheel vertical scrolling speed randomly resets back to it's lowest speed), that would be awesome.</p>
