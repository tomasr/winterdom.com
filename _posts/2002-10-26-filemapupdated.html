<p><!--start_raw-->I've just uploaded an updated version of my MemoryMapped Files implementation for .NET, which is just a wrapper around some of the MMF Win32 APIs.</p>
<p>This version fixes a couple of bugs that were present (thanks to Stephan Wolf for picking one of them up!), adds full support for IDisposable to both main classes, and improves the programming model a bit. This one also contains a few unit tests, and I hope to add more in the future as time allows.</p></p>
<p>You can grab the updated version (2.0.1.0) from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winterdom.com&#47;dev&#47;dotnet&#47;FileMap-2.0.1.zip">here</a></p><!--end_raw--></p>
