    <p>What does ASMX stand for?</p>

<font size="2">Doug Purdy&#160;posted&#160;an interesting <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.douglasp.com&#47;2003&#47;06&#47;18.html#a330">question</a> a<br />
couple of weeks ago regarding generics in the upcoming releases of .NET and what possible<br />
impact they could have on the ASMX WebServices and Remoting models (with remoting<br />
being the fairly obvious answer). </font><span ><font size="2">Being an opinionated<br />
and general trouble-making sould myself, I can't help but raise a few questions on<br />
the matter :)</font><br />
</span><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">I think the presence of generics in ASMX sounds fairly interesting<br />
from a theoretic point of view, but I can't help but wonder just how useful it would<br />
be in the real world. Specially troublesome is thinking just exactly what it means<br />
for the "describe-first-code-later" movement. How would you describe a service involving<br />
parametric types? I'm obviously no WS expert, but I can't see&#160;an obvious answer<br />
without at least partially loosing type information in the description.</font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">One wacky thought that comes to mind is the idea of generics and webservices<br />
intermingling to create <em>meta-services</em>: services that at one point in time<br />
(most likely during a late portion of a design phase) get <em>instantiated</em> over<br />
specific types so that the <em>real</em> service emerges. But if my worry above is<br />
real, this would need to happen <em>before</em> the final service is described using<br />
current tools. A meta-service would basically be composed of some sort of parameterized,<br />
meta-message description for input and&#160;output messages, which themselves could<br />
not be fully described using current tools. </font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">In a sense, if we go down to the SOAP level, we can already do generics:<br />
pass in whatever document we want (yes, with some restrictions, I know) within the<br />
body of the message. The problem is description, really. And if we were to have such<br />
a <em>meta-service</em> directly exposed somehow (which would imply some dynamic type<br />
creation based on the message payload), something else would need to be added to the<br />
message itself to "fill in the blanks", either through some sort of header, or with<br />
embedded schema information (yuck!). </font><br />
</p></p>
<p>
<font size="2">Again, I'm no expert here, so I might just be babbling, but&#160;I'm<br />
not sure just how&#160;useful this would actually be.... </font><br />
