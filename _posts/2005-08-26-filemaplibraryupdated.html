<p><!--start_raw-->I finally uploaded a long overdue update to my Filemap library for .NET (which implements file mapping facilities in managed code). This one mostly contains some minor refactoring and a few bugfixes, and it's one I had done a long time ago but had not put up (sorry for that!).</p>
<p>The updated version can be downloaded from <a href="&#47;dev&#47;dotnet&#47;FileMap-2.0.2.zip">here</a>.</p><!--end_raw--></p>
